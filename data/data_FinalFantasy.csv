"Fahiem Ahmadi","a year ago","SPOILER WARNING. 

Absolutely incredible. I am so glad I played Final Fantasy 7 Remake years ago. It was my first Final Fantasy experience ever. I always heard from family and friends about how great the series was and I always thought it was just some super anime fantasy game that looked depressing to me and never expected it to be what it was when I finally played FF7 remake. 

Given how much I loved Remake, I had high expectations for Rebirth but Square Enix absolutely blew my expectations out of the water completely. I was not expecting this game to be absolutely jam packed with so much detail and content to engage in. I spent over 100 hours playing this game and spent so much time just doing side quests which is something I NEVER do in a single player game. I usually will do some side content stuff but after a while I stick to main story and completely ignore side quests because they are usually boring, but in Rebirth, the side content is just as amazing and enjoyable as the main story.

Mini games galore! So many mini games that are so well thought out and fun to play. Queensblood had me addicted. Any time I entered a new region, I was looking for Queensblood. I was like a drug addict looking for some QB constantly. I couldn't get enough of it and who ever came up with this mini game is an absolute genius. 

Aside from the side content being amazing, the main story blew me away with each chapter. It was like the TV show Breaking Bad, it got better and better and better and never seemed to dwindle down like most big story games tend to do. I will say though that one criticism of the story I have is the multi verse concept they are introducing here. Multi verse stories usually don't end well and tend to collapse on itself once it starts to unfold and the ending was a bit confusing with Aerith dying and coming back multiple times, I felt it took away from the emotion of her death because you weren't actually sure what was happening. But I will say so far, the multi verse concept they are introducing isn't bad and I think they've handled it somewhat clearly so far but we'll have to wait for part 3 to know for sure.

The gameplay is just on another level in this game. The combat has been enhanced in almost every way from Remake and the introduction of Synergy attacks and being able to pick your team you go into battle with is just genius. 

The visuals are mindblowing. The set pieces, the different regions and areas are SO INCREDIBLY MASSIVE and so beautiful that it just takes your breath away sometimes. I loved all of the dark cave areas. Add on great performance with both the 30 and 60 fps options. Truly amazing how they are able to do this with such a Titan of a game. 

The music is just the cherry on top. The music gives you goosebumps and makes the game 10 times better. The music in this game is so unique and different from anything else I've ever heard from a video game or really any other form of entertainment.

I recommend this game to anyone who wants an amazing story loaded with side content and incredible graphics.","118 people found this helpful."
"Dustin Christie","a year ago","""Final Fantasy VII Rebirth"" is a testament to the enduring legacy and love that fans and creators alike hold for the original ""Final Fantasy VII,"" a game that originally graced the world over 25 years ago. This remake is not merely a retelling but a reimagining that breathes new life into the beloved story, characters, and world of Gaia, demonstrating an unparalleled commitment to both preserving and enhancing the essence of the original.

From the onset, it's clear that the developers at Square Enix have poured their hearts and souls into this project. The attention to detail is meticulous, from the reimagined yet faithful character designs to the expansive, beautifully rendered environments that feel both nostalgic and new. The developers have walked a fine line between innovation and preservation, updating the gameplay mechanics with a modern action-RPG twist that retains the strategic depth of the original's turn-based system, making it accessible to newcomers and satisfying for veterans.

The narrative depth of ""Final Fantasy VII Rebirth"" is where the game truly shines. The developers have taken great care to expand on the storylines of beloved characters, providing new insights and emotional depth that were not as explored in the original game. This approach enriches the overall experience, making every moment feel significant and every character's journey more impactful.

The music and sound design deserve special mention. The iconic score has been reimagined with orchestral arrangements that evoke a wide range of emotions, from nostalgia to excitement, enhancing every scene and battle. The voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life in a way that text alone could never achieve.

However, what makes ""Final Fantasy VII Rebirth"" truly remarkable is its ability to resonate with players on a personal level. It's a journey that reflects on themes of love, loss, and the fight against insurmountable odds, themes that are timeless and universal. The game manages to evoke a sense of wonder and adventure, while also providing a space for reflection on the human condition and our impact on the world.

In conclusion, ""Final Fantasy VII Rebirth"" is more than a game; it's a labor of love that honors its source material while forging its own path. It's a rare piece of art","151 people found this helpful."
"Mike Steele","4 months ago","I would love to start by saying this entry holds some of the best moments experienced in the original, with a good run time of 50-70 hours depending on the amount you decide to explore and tackle on thankfully every Biom is filled with tons of fun activities to uncover. As a huge fan of the Remake for the PS4. The sequel manages to capture the beauty of ff7s world and expands on it in almost every way. Starting with the characters that oozes with background and  development, then you have the story and honestly can be a hit or miss with the ending being a tad different from that of the original game, however on that note if you are to really put yourself into the protagonists shoes it actually wraps itself up nicely for setting up the 3rd entry. Gameplay is just a blast and every so often straight up a pain in the ass, but it never once stopped me from getting the highest scores possible, the combat from a hardcore FF golden age fan is definitely at its best, truly a solid rendition of what modernized ATB should be, as like in the Remake battle system soars as probably one of it's biggest highlights. From the random encounters to boss fights it does not fail to deliver the perfected performance for what a turn-based battle system should be in 2024. Hands down the best adventure for Final Fantasy since FFX and FFXII. While it is not perfect I'd still say it is a must play for any fan of the franchise. The ending could have been handle slightly better but all in all this was a solid homerun. Oh and did I mention it has an amazing soundtrack. Definitely a must play for true FF fans and anybody looking to play a modern RPG that is better then just decent. My only gripe is that it tends to go a bit overboard with the optional mini-games which had some cool equipment and accessories that can be obtained from getting top scores, overall though

"jesse zimmermann","11 months ago","As an FF7 fan since the original came out, this game nails it. 
Personally it’s one of my favourite games of all time. 
The characters and their relationships and how they react to each other is charming as hell. The open world is beautiful and I can’t gush enough about how amazing the towns were in this game. The side content is absolutely amazing and gives you great story tid bits and surprisingly rewards you with decent/great items for your troubles. An insane amount of mini games lol, it’s friggen insane how many awesome mini games there are.. and queens blood by the way, soooo damn addicting. Alllllmost as good as triple triad. The combat in rebirth is fantastic. Every character is so unique and has such a vast moveset it’s hard to experience it all. 

There were a couple things here and there that could have been better or left out of the game but mostly minor things that I would just be nit picking.

There’s so much to say about this game I don’t even know where to start or where to end lol. I’d suggest giving it a try. You won’t be disappointed.

Personally I’d give this game a 10/10
A non bias score, maybe a 9/10 - 9.5/10

Absolutely love it I can’t wait for the conclusion to this trilogy whenever it comes out.","30 people found this helpful."
"Kristopher Dalton","a year ago","People may have raised eyebrows when I announced my plan to take Thursday and Friday off work, granting myself a luxurious four-day weekend solely dedicated to immersing myself in the enchanting world of Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth. My journey with Final Fantasy 7 began at the age of 12, unfolding into a mesmerizing odyssey as I delved into its depths. It was a transformative experience, opening my eyes to the incredible storytelling and character development that gaming could offer, a revelation I previously associated only with literature and cinema.

When news broke in 2015 that SquareEnix had plans to reimagine Final Fantasy 7, I initially dismissed it as a distant fantasy. Yet, to my astonishment, 2020 brought forth the first installment of the long-awaited remake, sparking a surge of excitement tempered by a hint of apprehension. Having witnessed childhood favorites fall victim to lackluster reboots, I approached Remake (Part 1) with cautious optimism. However, as the credits rolled, it was evident that SquareEnix was committed to honoring the essence of the beloved narrative. Even with the massive change at the end of Remake.

With bated breath, I awaited February 29th, 2024, a date etched in my calendar with eager anticipation. True to form, Rebirth surpassed all expectations, seamlessly weaving together the iconic elements that made the original game a timeless classic. From the distinct personalities of each character to the breathtaking landscapes and intricate mythology, every facet of the beloved tale was meticulously recreated, inviting players to rediscover its magic with every twist and turn.

As I await the release of the final installment, I do so with renewed fervor and unwavering faith in SquareEnix’s ability to deliver an unforgettable conclusion. For in the realm of Final Fantasy 7, nostalgia isn’t just a fleeting emotion; it’s a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the profound impact it has on my life personally.","40 people found this helpful."
"Dave Meredith","a year ago","Legendary. From the moment it starts you know it's special. Beautifully crafted, great audio, a game with soul,purpose and yet somehow makes a world so big worth exploring. A legend reborn from a legend.

Clocked 40 hours plus with plenty more to do before reaching the end. It's one of the top ten games in my all time list and I've gamed for around 44 years. A truly stunning game and one that kept me interested at all times. It's pretty much a masterpiece of modern JRPG action based video games. So much attention to detail, the pacing is perfect,combat is sublime,story and characters are some of the best and it plays like a dream. At times the works is truly captivating in its beauty and design. I never felt bored or that things were bloated. Some Incredible story beats throughout and how these guys managed to turn a legendary game into a modern game thats aiming to please new and old, and pull it off is a remarkable testament to the skill of team responsible for this masterpiece. What's also fitting is the game is full of those amazing Japan only quirks throughout the game.. only Japanese Devs can do this and it's refreshing to see it here and done so well 

A true masterpiece and every gamer with a peak of interest needs to play this game.","23 people found this helpful."
"Michael Pettie","a year ago","I never played the original but watched videos of it and watched advent children and fell in-love with that movie so when I heard they were making remake years later I instantly bought it the day it dropped and fell in-love with the game.

Now with Rebirth I'm 10 hrs in and agree its GOTY worthy and a masterpiece! The upgraded open world opposed to remakes more linear style is invigorating. The translation between the original and its take on extending the overall game is breathtaking. It makes me want to 100 percent every region regardless of how long it takes. The mini games like Queen's Blood and the comical and fun take on Fort Condor SO FAR is playfully entertaining and adds a refreshing change in the pace of what would be considered repetitive. The differences of each regions needs for different Chocobbos continues to refresh the feeling of achievement in each areas exploration. The characters stories and interactions are far more advanced in rebirth and the combat is upgraded and fine tuned for a fun challenging experience. The graphics.... My god I thought the grasslands were beautiful but Junon... breathtaking views and incredible graphics can't wait to continue the experience. I have no cons for the game yet but will update as I progress. 5/5 Buy and beat Remake with the DLC first before starting Rebirth is my only other recommendation.","10 people found this helpful."
"Daniel Hovey","11 months ago","Combat: Combat is good, but the characters your not actively controlling barely build up any ATB gauge in battle. Personally I don't like there decision to add the ATB gauge, It just seems to make combat jankier.

Open World: Once more we have the appearance of the yellow paint telling us where we can climb. And, if you loved the yellow paint, they doubled down and gave us that for chocobos as well. Instead of giving us chocobo breeding they have boil down the chocobo abilities down to a regional gimmick. If they had gone with breeding, they could had hidden/blocked areas that would have us coming back to previous areas with the right or golden chocobos.	 They don't tell you there is a mini-map option nor how to switch to it. Someone needs to tell the developers that not every point of interest on the map needs to be a mini-game. I mean seriously we have Lifesprings(Quick-time), Sanctuaries(Memory/Quick-time), Moogles(don't know what genre this is), Excavation(Treasure hunting), Fiend Intel(Combat Challenge), Classified Intel(Mini-boss/elite), Chocobo hunting(Stealth), and finally Protorelics(Various). 

Controls: There is no good reason to not let players change their keybinds. They should of just added a jump button, it would help with hitting flying enemies with melee characters and the Terrain action buttons is already just a purposely limited jump.

Summons: Still not that good. The summon gauge has to be triggered to appear, limiting it usefulness in battle. This is a gripe I also had with Remake, but it seems like they tried to strike some weird balance with how summons work in 7 and failed. Instead they should of had summons work either as like in the original FF7, coming in launching one giant attack and costing MP, or something like 10 where the party disappears and you play as the summon. 

Moogles: They honestly look creepy.

The Weapons: Emerald weapons design is just a massive, horrible, disappointing, downgrade; whoever decide to take Emerald weapon and reduce its design down into a simple oversized fish with a giant green materia in its underside needs to fired.

Story:	Overall unimpressed with their version of this story, their changes are either hit or miss, unfortunately mostly miss. They do a great job expanding certain areas, but other areas feel exhaustingly and sometimes painfully bloated. In the beginning, I had hope that could deliver a good story, that would bring back the feeling of playing the original game, But as I delve into the game and more importantly its story this hope began dieing out. Instead of feeling impressed or engaged, most of the changes to the story left me feeling angry, bewilder, or just disappointed. The farther I progressed the story, the more I felt the need to force myself to finish this game. Until Ch 9 where this feeling reached such a level that I decided I needed to begin skipping as many of the remaining mini games and side quests as possible, in order to reach the end and be done with this game as soon as possible. I had specific chapters ready, with examples but the word count prevents from adding them.

Final Review: Although I love most of the visuals and combat, and maybe half of the mini-games, unfortunately the game's main campaign and story drag it down being its weakest point. I can't say i like this game, but I also can't say that I hate it either. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has ultimately left me with a sense of apathy. I do not look forward to any further installations or even other FF remakes after this. The only people I would recommend this game to, are people whom have neither played nor intend to ever play the original FF7.","31 people found this helpful."
"Kevin Klett","5 months ago","Just finished the game after 140 hours and absolutely loved every minute! What a fantastic journey full of emotions, awesome world building stunning landscapes and pure creativity. I was truly immersed and felt like I’m on a journey to save the planet. The city-locations in ff7 rebirth were my highlights (they get better and better from place to place). In general, there were so many unforgettable moments in this game that left me laughing, stunning and sometimes almost made me cry. Absolute worth every cent!! We should support these kinda games more since you realize they put a lot of love and passion in it.. the often criticized amounts of mini games were not a problem for me me at all: although I’m normally not a mini game fan, I finished them all (even on hard mode). And second: you can easily skip them if you want, without missing sth but extra armor.

"Jared Withrow","11 months ago","In a word: Masterpiece. Lives up to the fifty plus perfect scores. Upon finishing it I was left feeling so many things; all of which were most welcome. 

Having pre-ordered the game I was a bit salty at first because of certain technical issues, but thankfully the patch update significantly improved these and I was able to greatly enjoy the overall experience. 

I thought the ending was handled very well. It was artistically moving and mysterious to good effect. Granted I've never played the original all the way through so can't comment from that stand point but I was genuinely moved by this new ending and have gone back to compare with footage of the original. I'm sure the original was a big deal back in the day but what they managed to do with this new direction is quite grand.

Also have to mention Queens Blood which alone makes this a noteworthy title. Once that aspect of the game was realized I was hooked and had so much fun with that in addition to all the other fun side quests and minigames. All in all such a fantastic game to follow Remake. I'm a huge fan of both and can't wait for the next offering; thankfully there's enough content here to enjoy again and again!","4 people found this helpful."
"Bilal","a month ago","""Wow, what a game! Last Saturday was an absolute blast when I visited my cousin and got to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Steam. I must say, it's awesome in every aspect. Unlike many modern games that prioritize high graphics over other essential elements, this title truly delivers.

In recent years, even highly anticipated games have failed to meet audience expectations at launch, only to be patched up a year or two later. By then, the initial excitement has worn off, and the experience is no longer the same.

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, however, has a gripping storyline that's left me eager to purchase it for myself and play it again. The graphics are noticeably improved from the previous title, with no performance drawbacks. 

I was impressed to find that my cousin's budget-friendly PC build, featuring an RTX 4060, i5-9500, and 32GB of RAM, handled the game smoothly.

In fact, I played it on a Samsung 4K TV at 60Hz, with DLSS enabled and a mix of high and medium settings, and still achieved a consistent 60fps.

Highly recommended! Kudos to the developers for a job well done.""","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Netorare Fan Club","11 months ago","A fantastic experience worth every penny. 

Some people have complained about the padding. There is a TON of extra content that is optional - mini games, open world ""scavenger-hunt"" type quests, side quests etc. If you don't enjoy that stuff you 100% can skip it and just bee-line the main plot. I enjoyed it mostly cause you get to experience the beautiful moments, environments and see more fun character interactions. I think generally speaking, if you really vibe with the characters and enjoy spending time with them, you'll love the game. If you want a more serious, straight to the point, concise sort of game, this might not be for you. 

It's like the Harry Potter books. People who really like the characters enjoy the books cause they enjoy the trio's personalities, banter, interactions, side characters and have a good time just being in the world. The plot and writing is kind of secondary to this. 
I've been checking out the reviews and comments from youtube and reddit. I'll say the people who dislike FF7 rebirth fall into 3 categories:

People who play too many games - (maybe specifically ubisoft open world games??) Seems like the FF7 openworld gameplay is alot like those kind of games. They expect too much. Everything needs to be innovative and fresh. Personally, i've never played assassin's creed, horizon, farcry, so I enjoyed this non-mmo open world experience.

 Original FF7 purists - These people are constantly comparing this remake playthrough with the OG experience in mind. So certain events may feel ""dragged out"" or ""off"". They kind of have this rosy perception of the original when they played it as a kid. So nothing the remakes do can ever meet their expectations.

Grumpy old men - Similar to how old heads treated the Star Wars prequels when they came out. They lost their ""child like imagination"" and fail to appreciate the aspects of the game that appeal to younger audiences (humor, colorful characters, anime/cartoony dialogue). As gamers, they've maybe outgrown this genre and would better enjoy more M-rated games with tons of cussing, violence, and more mature themes.","4 people found this helpful."
"Ran Moore","a year ago","It's an odd sensation to relive the feelings and experiences I had back in 1997 with the original even though I already know the story. 
Upon finishing this game I want to encourage more people to play it as it is very well done and a modern example of what final fantasy was to me growing up.
There is alot to do in this game that justifies the purchase and hours invested and also offers replayability.
While the graphics are not perfect it didn't prevent me from getting sucked into the game and happily getting immersed for days and with a patch on the way that shouldn't be a problem for long.
The music goes from one amazing track and straight into another, I found myself putting the controller down and just listening to the music.
I don't play horror games as I value my mental health and was pleased this game was not grotesque nor frightening. 
It will be hard to wait 4 or 5 more years for the third game but I will gladly do it as this is my new favorite final fantasy.

Just got done playing Rebirth...
So here goes, just absolutely amazing amazing game so many things to do and explore and the fact that it  is more lively in every way shape or form....yes the tons of side quests and mini games can get a bit tiring and annoying but if you focus and see what you have to do you will eventually get past them....as for the storyline it does make Cloud and Aerith have more of a connection or relationship without it being a relationship, I prefer Tifa but honestly not bad ending with Aerith especially in the carousel ride in chp 12

The final fight does seem to drag quite a bit in suspense which is great but also has its setback in my opinion but once you fight Sephiroth there's no turning back
Just have to finish him

Between this, GoW Ragnarok, and Horizon: Forbidden West it is clear that the developers of the RPG genre have completely run out of ideas. If you play any one of these games, you have essentially played all of them. The whole genre is so watered down by a template that was created 20-ish years ago (Assasin’s Creed was the first game I played like this). The gaming world is badly in need of innovation. The only new or unique feature here are the mini-games, which are mind numbingly boring at best and, at worst, are so frustrating that it borders on trauma. The flow and tone of the game is consistently disrupted, sometimes for close to an hour, so you can shoot at balloons with points on them or solve pseudo sudoku puzzles with trading cards. It makes no sense within the tone or the environment that they take place in. Especially since there is an entire mini-game themed amusement park at the center of the game where players can spend as much time grinding as they’d like, though I can’t imagine why anyone would want to do that. Why put them at the center of almost every other area as well? It’s poor design meant to stretch the game, but it is just flat out bad content. 

Just in case a game developer ever reads this: dysfunctional and difficult do not mean the same thing. I think there is some kind of conspiracy with Sony to create intensely frustrating games to make players break as many controllers as possible. Seriously, who the hell is buying Final Fantasy games because they want to test their gaming skills defeating terrible A.I. in clunky, chaotic hack and slash battles that are only difficult because of some very gimmicky paper rock scissor style combat mechanic that forces you to “scan” each enemy? or racing chocobos on a track where the obstacles are so frustrating that it is impossible to actually enjoy the experience? Not me. I love a challenge, but not at the cost of playability. This game wildly misses that balance. 

The people calling this a front runner for game of the year are probably right, and that is tragic. Video games have gotten noticeably worse with this generation of consoles, and it’s not just RPGs. The sports games are bad, the action/adventure games are mostly bad…. Honestly, the best games being made now could have been made 10 years ago on much worse technology. It is truly disappointing, and I hope it turns around soon because I love unwinding after a long week with some solid RPGs. So far, I am not impressed with this generation of consoles.","53 people found this helpful."

Every single aspect of this game is incredibly breathtaking and fine tuned to near perfection; the soundtrack is majestic, the themes are incredulous, the open world aspect is invigorating, the gameplay is superb, but the masterpiece of the game and its crowning aspect is 100% the story and how it has been uniquely done to be in step with the original. 
And for the people who have played the original, this game does such an unbelievably excellent job bringing the characters, their stories, pains, struggles, and happiness to life in a new and invigorating way that will appeal to our sense of nostalgia while keeping it uniquely new and fresh.

"Colin Healy","7 months ago","Final Fantasy VII Rebirth offers a deep dive back into the world of Midgar, expanding on its predecessor's legacy with a mix of nostalgia and fresh twists. The game brilliantly captures the essence of its characters, with Cloud's evolving complexity and Aerith's profound depth standing out particularly. The exploration of lore, especially concerning Jenova and the Cetra, provides a rich narrative tapestry that is as engaging as it is intricate.

However, the game is not without its frustrations. The narrative decision to incorporate multiple timelines introduces a level of complexity that seems more distracting than enriching. While it aims to add layers to the story, it often feels like an unnecessary convolution that detracts from the main narrative's emotional and thematic core.

The combat system remains exhilarating, blending classic mechanics with innovative updates that keep the encounters fresh and exciting. The visual and auditory presentations are, as expected, top-notch, with each scene beautifully crafted to enhance the emotional and dramatic stakes.

In conclusion, Rebirth is a commendable sequel that mostly succeeds in bringing new life to its revered source material. While not all narrative experiments hit the mark, the game's ambitious approach to storytelling and its faithful yet fresh portrayal of beloved characters make it a worthy journey for both old fans and new.","3 people found this helpful."

"Matt Wilkinson","10 months ago","Where to begin? First thing that struck me while playing the demo was how all foliage doesn’t move and clips through the characters to the point you can stand in a bush and it cuts through, lazy, but I thought “they will fix this in the final release” nope, you run straight through foliage as it’s not really in the game world it’s just a texture, clips through characters, railway tracks clip through character, it deliberately feels padded out, the areas are huge and baron, again they are this size so you can spend absolutely ages travelling to different locations just to pad out the game time, cloud will boot large pieces of furniture, metal, wood etc as if they weigh absolutely nothing. And the worst thing is by far….”queens blood”…oh this game…a card game that it FORCES you to play on numerous occasions, even enters you in a tournament playing it, but you might think “wel ill deliberately loose” doesn’t matter, you get told to either try again or find an easier opponent, you can eventually just quit by speaking to a staff member though. It sucks because this game makes no sense, you place cards down on a board and collect tokens at the end, the problem is it seems to change the winning requirements and not tell you. Story is good when it isn’t being dragged out over overly large, dead areas that look very very low res. This suffers from the rose tinted glasses, it’s ok to play through once, but I haven’t done any side quests because they again are all drawn out and overly complicated but I will not play through again. The highlight is seeing sephiroth being badass and tormenting cloud.
And finally finishing it square have managed to do exactly the same as 16. Not pick a conclusive ending, rather sit on the fence and not make any real decisions.","8 people found this helpful."
"Steven Vernau","a month ago","An absolute tour de force. Really had the spirit of FF7 in all the best ways. So much optional content, and while I liked remake, rebirth was on another level. 
Combat improved from remake, with a perfect blend of turn based strategy and real-time intensity, this is what a modern Final fantasy title should be. While I enjoyed ff16, it didn't feel like a final fantasy title, but a western action game. But rebirth had all the charm you expect from a true JRPG, connecting you emotionally to the game in a way Western games just don't do.
Up there in quality with read dead 2 and last of us, but in my favourite genre, I can say this is almost the perfect game. 98 out of 100, would have given it 100 but always have to leave room for something better, perhaps the trilogy finale will force me to give 100!

"Kayla Adams","9 months ago","FFVII (OG) was the video game that changed my life. My grandma used to take me to the local flea market where I found a stand that sold knives, fishing lures, random old hand tools, road signs, and also a small selection of video games. I picked up FFVII for $5 (and still have that very copy 22 years later). 

I give Rebirth a solid 3 stars. The graphics are phenomenal. I appreciate exploring the world. I enjoy the affection system which tracks your teammates positive/negative association with you. Battle is pretty fun (I used the newer battle tactics since I figured they were created intended for this game) — easy battles are button mashing and more challenging battles require incorporating some strategy. I’ve been enjoying the new take on the story thus far and am excited to see where it goes. 

I docked it two stars because I feel like the level of repetition with the side missions is driving me up the wall. I know I could skip it but I feel like I owe my inner child every painful detail of these remakes. I had to take a break from this game for a couple months though because the side missions were driving me crazy. They’re all courier (running from point A to B back to A) missions or slayer (find monster, slay it) missions. The bigger side quests do have some story sustenance but all the little “intels” are shallow and take up 80% of the game. Chadley annoys the #%^* out of me and he never shuts up. And in general, Rebirth places more emphasis on graphics and an immersive world (which it excels at) than the astounding story of its predecessor. Obviously it still has story, but I feel like that gets lost in the weeds (literally when you’re doing your intel missions). Many folks probably don’t care about that but as an adult with a limited amount of free time, it bums me out to spend two hours straight on intel only to make a small dent in the total region intel (and there’s many regions — which is cool). 

I’d say these remakes are good for introducing folks to FF and they are better than the XI and up games, but they also just lack that extra magic that was in those early FF games (X and earlier). Should have made it one (or even two) game(s) and cut out a bunch of the filler. Hate to say it but, classic money grab.

"Concerned Guest","5 months ago","For players that want to accomplish anything completely I would not recommend this. It’s good for a run through but not for a complete. It’s extremely obvious this game was made for investors to see how many hours you’re going to waste your time on this game so they get money out of it. Final Fantasy 16 failed for good reason, like any American to Japanese anything, Final Fantasy 16 White Washed players from NPC’s to Playable Characters (It was just HBO MAX’s Game Of Thrones) minus actual real human beings from across the globe. Final Fantasy 7 Re:Birth included all of Planet Earths Humans. On part 3 of Final Fantasy 7 it’ll be the lowest cost option to run through the story and never touched again. Theres no way anyone is going to want to spend 1,000’s of hours wasting time on Weapons. The final chapter is clearly going to be a cash grab for the investors on how much time was spent playing. This actually has boosted my interest more in my XBOX Series X just to have fun, thats the whole point of escaping reality with video games, we’re about to lose all fun when Gen Z & Gen Alpha made it right, let us have infinite lives and exact save points where we last started. No more of this extremism, thats why SquareEnix games keep dying off, you guys are living in the past while Gen Z & Alpha Creators are making it fun again.","2 people found this helpful."
"Grant Bernard","a year ago","Excellent game. I enjoyed ff7 remake for the battle system and nostalgia mostly. ff7 rebirth takes that up several levels. The original overworld has been created in a semi-open world with some beautiful, detailed locations that have been recreated from those static backdrops into 3d lively environments. The  Battle system is more awesome than remake with a few new systems and more playable characters.
Round that off with great music and a great story with a few new twists but with a lot of the originals DNA.
A modern classic.
One day after the 3rd game comes out it would be a great 1st time experience to play all 3 games as one for my kids.

"Andrew Csizmadia","a year ago","After playing the first installment and being blown away how's good it was, this is so much better!
The open world let's you play how you want to.
There's no rush to get from one place to another.
It's HUGE!
I spent most of 20 hours just cruising around the grasslands, there's so much to see, so much to collect.
While I've seen complaints about the writing, yea, some of it can seem pretty simple, but that's kind of the joy of Final Fantasy games.
A few of the ""boss"" fights in the simulations will give you fits, but, with a few tries you can level up enough to take them down and get a few great summons.
The side quests are... Interesting, the free I've come across so far have been just ok...
With that, it's a very enjoyable game, I can definitely see myself spending a couple hundred hours just exploring fully the very large map.

"Mitz C","a year ago","GOD I LOVE THIS GAME. You can really see there's so much effort put into it. So far in my opinion has the best towns in videogame history, the idle chatters of NPCs is just 👌. The travelling system, the exploration and goodness me—the mini games! The mini games can be a standalone game. ( Im looking at you Queens Blood) 

Side Quests that is even worth doing because you'll be rewarded by bits of character lore scenes

The best part: TEAM SYNERGIES! Different synergies per pair, and different type of coolness and epicness. (Air combat is 🥵🤙) 

Dont even get me started with the music THAT CHANGES and becomes more melodic everytime you explore/unlock more of a region's map. 

Kudos to Square! Making a big game like this in a short number of time.

"Angeleen Buske","11 months ago","I'm loving this game! I've been playing it since release day.  It far exceeds FFVII Remake. I'm a completist when playing RPG video games in general - I love doing all the side quests. So all the mini games in this game are fun side quests for me. The biggest thing I love about this game is there isn't anything repetitive. Everything feels fun and fresh, and I'm still feeling this way going into Chapter 8. Queen's Blood is by far my favorite game inside a video game. Before FFVII Rebirth, it's been Gwent from Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. I love playing the piano in this game too! This game is so refreshing for me, it's extremely different from all the rpgs that have been out for some time. I love the route they went with upping the mini games for this game. If your playing style sounds similar to mine, you will love this game.","4 people found this helpful."
"David Trautz","a year ago","This game takes everything from the original and twists it into a new imagining of the same events. A lot of people look at this as a downside or say that Nomura os ruining the compilation of final fantasy 7 with all of his inclusions, but forget that Nomuras influence is what made the OG 7 so incredible in the first place. This game takes out a majority of what made remake feel so laborious. The goofy tone comes back a lot (which was much needed) and the open zones are beautifully done. All the minigames are well done and the cinematic events are jaw dropping. Cloud gets a huge mental update and his ‘episodes’ are done WAYYY better than what was originally presented. If I have any gripes, it’s having to walk .1 mph at some points, or being forced to play queens blood, but on the other side of that coin, queens blood is such a good game (might like it more than triple triad) and the slow points emphasize the severity of what’s happening. These 1 star reviews are just from people who want a 1:1 remaster of the original but this game is a reMAKE. Like a reimagining from the original creators. It’s their vision of the story THEY created and I say that they nailed it","10 people found this helpful."
"Claire Zhang","a year ago","I’m in chapter 11, minor spoiler alert on annoying mini game parts only

Great:
I loved remake combat, the combat is even better in rebirth. Options of play style strategy abundant, making it fun to explore.

I loved the story parts that gave so much depth to Barret and Red. 

Some mini games are super fun! I think queen’s blood is pretty good. 

Meh:
The pacing of the story is at glacial speed to start. I felt very stagnant with a lot of mandatory mini games to almost fill the time? So you can break it into three full game? 

Words cannot express how annoyed I was with chapter 11. The mandatory Cait Sith box throwing, one box, fine. Two boxes, fine. It was hours of very poorly designed, pointless, absolutely tedious box throwing. That killed my momentum that’s been going well on the storyline at that point. 

The open world exploration is OK. I find the protorelic missions fun, different every time. The first one was awful. The rest was pretty interesting. The life spring, tower climbing, truly were just repetitive. I did them for completions reasons, and to get the special fight in each region. 
The side missions, which I did 99% of up to this point, are largely fetch quests, some having more interesting stories but definitely the minority. 

Open world games like Horizon, Witcher, have evolved so far beyond, rebirth felt like a major step down, even if it’s a step up from its predecessor. 

Overall, I think the game has amazing qualities that make it stand out. Instead of endless mini games (some I enjoyed) and the repetitive exploration, a few meaningful character building side missions would have had a much bigger impact. This game can be 20 hours shorter, probably would have been better.","7 people found this helpful."

I'm about 75% through the campaign right now and am so happy with this game. I look forward to playing it when I have free time and really don't understand why people have anything negative to say about this game. It's everything you should expect from a typical Final Fantasy game and nothing about the game has felt rushed in development like they were just trying to get the game out like a money grab.

Amazing adventure, lots to do, fun, unique etc. The camera and targetting system were pretty bad, difficulty levels not balanced, graphics are good except rendering in some areas is terrible, cutscenes could do with a save/exit option as some are maybe 30mins long and you just have the option to skip or resume, the final boss battles were annoying due to a checkpoint issue, going back and doing side quests is very annoying as it makes you pick a main chapter you have already completed and then you must complete that objective before it allows you to fast travel. This game had so much potential to be 10/10. I think a linear approach instead of open world would have resulted in a more polished game. This game is HUGE","4 people found this helpful."

"Erin Lockman","3 months ago","(Some story spoilers ahead in my review, be warned!)
While I LOVE FFVII and Remake was a solid 5 stars from me, Rebirth left me wanting more from it than it actually delivered.

To soften the review, I'm going to start with what I actually liked about the game: 
The graphics were phenomenal! The music was nostalgic and wonderful!
I loved everything about the play from Loveless! The music, the dance, the costumes, Jessie, the lyrics of the goddess (aka Jenova and her subtle manipulation on the world)... and while I missed the goofiness of the original (Tifa kicking the dragon offstage in a fit of rage) this didn't deter from my enjoyment.
Barret's story got a massive overhaul and genuinely made me really connect with his character a lot more.
I also really appreciated the Junon scene. I seriously thought that Rufus was going to ally with Cloud and party and was pleasantly thrown off.
The kissing scene between Tifa and Cloud was something that was lacking from the original, and I'm so glad that they put it in the ""remade"" version.

Now to the criticism...
In Remake, I played all the minigames and sidequests to get the most valuable rewards and roleplay in the game. Firstly, I was completing the game thinking that there would be some carry-over from the previous part instead of how the creators envisioned: each game being a separate installment. That meant level 1, no materia, no previous weapons. Wow.
The other major complaint as far as gameplay goes that I had with Rebirth is that it oversaturated itself with sidequests and pull-out-your-hair minigames to the point where I just said F it and went straight to the end without looking back. Chadley was a great addition to Remake but just became downright annoying in Rebirth.

Exploration was a bit of a pain. 
Where was the Chocobo breeding? The races felt more of a hassle than something I looked forward to.
I liked Queen's blood after learning the rules a bit more, but it shouldn't have become a requirement on Rufus's ship to Costa del Sol.

My biggest criticism was the story.
I felt like they had this magnificent twist in Remake---the fates---and completely threw the idea out of the window in Rebirth, overall making me feel frustrated with the writing. Remake promised us that there was going to be some change, and while we did have some moderate story twists, it didn't change the core of the plot. Everyone that was destined for something bad in the original still happened to them. And those that were not meant to be there but were in the game as filler (Zack, I'm talking about you) didn't really change anything or do anything significant other than show up in the final boss fight as more of a cameo than an asset, which quite frankly, I could've done without.

Those that have played the original FFVII game and have even watched the Advent Children movie, I'm sure you're aware that a certain scene, certain feeling of the game, were left out of the second part's ending. It left me bitter, frustrated, angry that the writer's chose this path. I understand that they were setting the stage for Cloud's impending insanity for the third installment, but they took out one of the most impactful scenes. To me, this was a slap in the face to a long time FF fan.

Overall, my experience with the remake of FFVII was moderately positive, and I understand that not everyone can be happy with a decision when there's such a massive fan base to a legendary title.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"E C","a month ago","All of these final fantasy games are a far cry from their glory days and are just smash button games with terrible physics and lazy game designing with mistakes in the graphics everywhere which is astonishing with today's technology . During fights I would compare it to much earlier final fantasy games/ an arcade like fighting game such as Marvel VS Capcom. Everything is jumping around like a horrible Michael Bay Transformers movie in an attempt to hide a bad game, It is unbelievable to me that people including myself have waited so long for this game and this is what they came up with. The games within the game are basically carnival games. So many mini games in fact that this game is basically just a collection of a bunch of stupid games within the game instead of making a good game that could stand on its own. The older games like 1 through 10 I'd say used to have way more characters, much better story lines and somewhat challenging puzzles with more possible hidden discoveries of items, gil, weapons, armor and accessories in dresser drawers and other hidden places like secret passages. They even copied Zelda: Breath of the Wild by foraging for  herbs and such but instead of cooking you hold a button down to transmute it.....clever... Also lame. I am left disappointed and confused as the game seems to try to entice a younger crowd while keeping the older final fantasy enthusiasts happy but continuously adding swearing like it is cool or something. I am blown away by how much development supposedly went into this game that feels awfully rushed Horrible just horrible. Go back to the games roots and use today's technology to make them look better. Same goes for every genre game like NHL. All of these games are just lazy money grabs. Zelda and other Nintendo games blow any game out of the water that PlayStation of whom supposedly has the superior gaming system has come up with so far.","1 person found this helpful."

"Drew Ted","6 months ago","full review at {drewted}.{com}

Let me preface this review by saying: I absolutely love the FF7 and its story. The game has insane world building, beautiful and touching character interactions that do not seem like an afterthought. The combat mechanics are fun, with more focus on the new synergy attacks. The various regions are open world and are unbelievably detailed and in theme; the monsters, chocobos design, side quests all have been thought out meticulously and are mostly fun to do.

So believe me when i say, I really want to give this game a 5 star. Yet, to do so would be dishonest of me. The game starts really fun - new mechanics are introduced chapter by chapter - and I really did want to complete them all. However, by chapter 7-8, i was starting to get really fatigued by the sheer amount of side content. Some regions (2 in particular, iykyk) are unbelievably hard to navigate, and i had to end up looking for solutions on youtube) 

Still, this game is definitely awesome and is a very strong recommend to anyone. I ended up ignoring side content from later half of the game, and still had around 85 hours of playtime. Chapter 13 and 14, in particular, were extremely exciting and kept me glued to my PS5. Thanks to SE for this beautiful game!","1 person found this helpful."

Has me not wanting to put the controller down yet I want to stop playing because I know that with every step closer, means I am one step closer to finishing and leaving the journey.

"Cody Auger-Beaulieu","a year ago","FF7R was terrible. It was filled with fluff to make a full game and as an A/J/RPG it was lacking in almost every department. The only high points were more screen time for the 3 Amigos (story wise) and the Materia system. I have never hid that I really didn't like it... but Rebirth has fixed 95% of what was wrong with Part 1. It's incredible. Minigame fluff excluded, it's an incredible RPG. Exploring, party optimization, side quest, content, blah blah is all red lined compared to FF7R. I'm a 100% (including minigames and side content ) at CH12 and I'm hitting 82 hours on Dynamic difficulty. There's tons to do and I haven't even touched Hard mode playthrough yet (though I've finished the minigames).

"jin dan","a month ago","Very well made game, FF7 remake and rebirth are actually awesome games but with some issues.  Lots of contents, great story and adaptation to the original.  

Some known issues:
-Too many mini games has ruined it, I dont mind a bit of it, but too many has become a complete nuisance/distraction, I would prefer to focus a bit more on the main story.  Fort condor, gears and gambit, 3d brawler, desert rush, glide de chocobo, jump frog, moogle mischief, cactuar crush can actually be cut as they arent really that fun to play.  Piano game should include iconic songs rather that difficult and uninteresting ones.  Mini games should only takes a little bit of time, not require players to grind a ton of hours on ridiculously unfair conditions for some crap rewards, which is a complete waste of time.
- Contrast in lighting is too high. A lot of areas are either overblown or pitch black, relying too much the auto exposure in Unreal, it should be post processed to tune down a little. The background fog is as well too strong, leading environments covered in a white haze which is unappealing.
- Terrain travel is too choppy. Chocobos and characters should be able to roam freely, rather then to an awkward stop when hitting a little plant or rock, it should continue to run.
- Chadley and mai voices are too high, almost hurts to listen.
- Battle cameras suddenly switches to awkward positions, not even seeing the enemy. This is a bug that wasnt in previous game, I would prefer it to stay like previous one.
- Materias should be able to transferred from previous game and unlocking hard difficulty from start, I had a bunch already maxed out but now needing to rebuild all is kind of ridiculous. It's a pain to setup the overloads of materias when switching members/adapting to enemies.
- Limits and skill tree are kind of nerfed, replaced by synergy skills. High limits levels are hard to reach in battles, I would prefer limits stay like the previous game where you can choose.
- The interaction button is a bit hard to touch, needing to face to correct direction which misses all the time, the area should be larger.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"sarianna saberwolf","a year ago","I've had enough of Nomura's cynical, lazy writing for one lifetime.  So much more than enough.  So many people did an incredible job holding up their end of this project, but the juvenile, overly (and boringly) twisty plot populated with fate ghosts is so, so bad.  These ""remakes"" seek to fix what was never broken, but their ""improvements"" only reveal that they don't understand or appreciate what made FF7 good in the first place.  Every ounce of meaning, resonance, and artful world-building has been stripped away from this property, clarifying that Squeenix has no interest in doing this title or series justice.  I feel genuinely sad for all the gamers who are being introduced to FF7 for the first time through this atrocious, zombified corpse of a game (and its predecessor, FF7 ""Remake"").  And if anybody from Squeenix is listening: please, for the love of god, stop giving Nomura the power to defecate all over your most beloved IP.

"Sufian Chaudhary","11 months ago","What a huge disappointment of a remake…

I’m a massive FF7 fan. Played the original back in the 90s. It was honestly mind-blowing and completely groundbreaking for its time. FF7 Rebirth is a childlike conglomeration of annoying mini games and repetitive fetch quests, made for literal children who need to be babied the whole way through.

Pros:

- Graphics are an improvement over the original. The world looks stunning. They brought to life the FF7 world in a truly beautiful way. 
- Combat is awesome, real-time and fast paced enough to keep you engaged.
- Voice acting is overall very good.


Cons

- The developers have deviated so far away from the original storyline, that it’s hard to call this a remake. The addition of fate-wielding ghosts was a major and completely unnecessary mistake. It spells lazy story writing. Just why?
- The original FF7 felt more open world than this version does. The whole game is completely boxed in. Every map has the exact same quests. It’s paint-by-numbers. Climb the nearest tower, go to these icons, kill a couple of monsters. There is absolutely no incentive to explore. The world is barren outside of the paint-by-numbers locations.
- The mini games become tedious after the 56th one. It’s like buying a FF game and discovering you actually bought hundreds of terrible and unsellable iPhone games that you have to complete to progress to the next paint-by-numbers area.
- Your in-game handler, Chadley, is extremely annoying. The game now revolves around him. He didn't even exist in the original FF7.
- Pick a timeline, and stick with it Square Enix. The multiverse idea was another fatal mistake. Where did this even come from? Why am I randomly made to sulk around unconscious bodies as Zack? 
- Weapons are only as good as their special abilities. Find a new weapon, use its ability 3 times to permanently save it. Discard the weapon for what you were already using. Most weapons are weaker than what you find early game.
- They removed combing materia that opened up secret abilities and spells. Now we are saturated with vending machines that have endless supplies of every item.
- Here’s 50 more mini games to fill in the story where what should have been 1 game, has now magically turned into 3 separate purchases.
- There’s absolutely no sense of exploration. You are held by the hand and guided to every single thing. Repeating bird swooping in to show you where crystals are. Baby chocs doing the same thing for stops. Guide crystals showing you where to find summon intel. It gets tedious.
- I’m bored at 50 hours in. I already know the next pant-by-numbers map is going to be a re-skin of what I just completed. 


I had high hopes for this game. It’s sad the remake has deviated so badly from the original. So many of the reviews here saying the word “masterpiece”. Must be paid or bots. 

If you like endless iPhone mini games, this is the game for you. 1 purchase grants you 100 mini games, all combined together by a weird multiverse storyline that is guaranteed to confuse you!

"Nicholas Jacques","a year ago","This game has a lot of offer from beautiful animation, great voice acting (not script writing), and some character leveling and weapon proficiency mechanics that can provide a subtle feeling of fulfillment. Unfortunately, for every victory, there are numerous failures for FF7 Rebirth. 

The fast paced, story propelling, boss battle centric arcs offer a lot in terms of enjoyment and satisfaction, they are far too infrequent and are so dramatically overshadowed by an open world that’s tedious to navigate, side quests and mini games that very quickly become boring, and mechanics (for open world interactions, mini games and combat) that taint all of the good things that this entry has to offer. 

The true kiss of death is in the characters themselves. This may be an effect of the original title being split into three separate games, but is not enough to excuse such an unfortunate disappointment this is. The prime example is in the dissonance between Cloud and Tifa that is present from the very beginning of the game. The overwrought dialogue makes this discomfort unbelievable. It seems to come out of no where and does not resolve itself at a pace that makes it satisfying to play out. 

While life long fans of the franchise will still find enjoyment in this release, and rightfully so, I suspect that this game ultimately will not attract many new fans to the series. I myself have been disappointed with the latest releases in the franchise and this may very well be the last FF game I play.","21 people found this helpful."

I love playing as Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie, and Red XIII, they're so fun. Sephiroth is absolutely terrifying in Rebirth, and there are moments that make me laugh, feel emotional, and more.

"Searos Frederick","9 months ago","Game starts strong but slowly becomes repetitive and bloated with side content. While side content is optional it's the source of a lot of good materia and items. The open areas don't reward exploration but rather become zones with check lists to complete which feels very dated. 

The characters and music are the best part of the game. I would say the gameplay is great if your party members did something while not being actively controlled. I get this is to promote switching but it's less effective in active combat and for later challenge with very specific ways of pressuring and staggering enemies it's annoying.

The story is also something that is intriguing and fun.... at first. By the end of the game the plot is nonsensical and doesn't really feel satisfying knowing we are gonna have to wait years to see the ramifications. Overall the game starts strong but for every fun part there are 2 or 3 little annoying bits that add up as the game goes on and brings down the overall experience.","3 people found this helpful."
"Kingslayer36","6 months ago","A very great, fairly flawed game.

When your in the actual story it feels great and paced well, but the game has too much of a problem with bogging you down with tons of honesty unimportant things.

If you like mini games you'll like this if not you won't. They were a fun change of pace for middling rewards half the time.

Side quests that feel somewhat repetitive, though interesting one offs with small character moments that I believe are very necessary because...

Although this game isn't perfect, far from it, It's the characters and the games job and endearing them to me that make up for its flaws. I hope the final game masters this formula.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Wanderlust Ramblers","a year ago","I’m only about halfway through the game from what I can tell, but I really felt the need to address the 1 star ratings.

Let’s start by saying- nothing will ever replace the original. I was a 12yo when the original released in 1997. It was a majestic and enthralling part of my gaming childhood. There’s only one other RPG (also by Squaresoft) that I would put ahead of it, but this review isn’t about other games. 

Final Fantasy VII. The first trek into the 3d world for Final Fantasy. Ushering in the time of multi-disc games. Really giving you the feeling that you were committing to a lengthy endeavor. It was fantastic. The game had its cheesy moments. It had its story holes and frustrations. However, it was a masterpiece. And it will always retain that aspect for any OG of the time.

Now, here we are, closing in on 30 years later. Things are flashier, folks want stuff faster and turn based mechanics are a thing of the past. It was hard for me to get past some of this stuff, but It isn’t ‘all for naught.’

I love the classics. I wanted to stay there forever. I wasn’t super impressed with Remake and, I’ll be honest, I set myself up to hate this game as best I could before the demo even released. However, here we are, a few days into the launch of Rebirth, and I can’t put it down. The game is great.

It has its flaws, just like any other game. The regions have somewhat repetitive objectives, the dialogue can be a little goofy at times, and chocobos, clinging to a vertical wall, is a bit silly. Once you get past all that, the experience is a blast. The battle system is a great (coming from someone that thinks anything other than turn-based combat in an RPG is a travesty). The story, though diverting from the original a bit, is still grasping and keeps you interested. And the new mini games are a blast! The piano, in particular, has kept me busy for quite a while.

As I said, I’ve only completed a portion of this segment with the new age FF7, but so far it’s been great. It may not be the original of years past, but it’s a great game with lots of fantastic aspects for the new age.

For those of you giving the game 1 star, because it isn’t the 1997 version of the game, I ask- what were you expecting? I understand wanting to stick to the roots. And in many ways, it has done so, but you can’t fight progress forever. 

It’s a phenomenal game and a fantastic salute to the times of old.

Don't normally do this but wow I had to for something so dear to my heart (the 1997 original). While I liked the Remake and was interested where the story was going and knew this whole thing wasn't a one to one redo of the original I was indeed looking forward to where the Rebirth story was going to take us. Well one word, QTE, oh man! press random buttons for this press random buttons for that, and don't get me started on mini games, I think oh this quest will lead me to learn something new and may add to the story.....oh mini game, they are never ending. Don't get me wrong I love Queens Blood, if they made an phone app for that alone I'd pay money for that, but about 90% of the others are pointless filler. Can't say I'm impressed with the story just a bit meh though it has been fun to discuss with friends on what we think is happening. Not a massive fan of the blocking system having to be spot on with it or maybe I'm rubbish but hey just got to a certain battle and got so fed up with it (don't expect to walk a battle just annoyed me) I ended up deleting the game as after all I've been through I have no interest in finishing it and I'll just watch the ending on Youtube at some point. Honestly this doesn't make me want to buy the next instalment. Remember more isn't always better.

"Lisa Hunter","8 months ago","Well I guess Square decided they were too good to properly fund their QA team because the game is horrifically imbalanced. Seriously, google ""ff7 rebirth impossible"" and see the results. So many battles you have to drop down to easy mode and even then some of the battles in the combat simulator are a severe struggle, even after doing the mini quests to make the fights easier. Rarely are the fights fun, getting you to use your mind and strategy like in the first game; they're just tedious, expecting you to master the perfect block and woe is you if you can't. This game is also bloated with mini games, some which are fun but some of which are straight up ridiculous (looking at you, chicken clunker game). Whereas Remake really expanded moments in the original story, Rebirth has you spending hours in every single region doing the same run-around checklist over and over, breaking the flow of the story and feeling repetitive. The story itself and character development is intriguing enough and my love for FF7 is still holding strong enough for me to see Rebirth through, but the high rating this game is getting is solely on the fact that it's FF7 and thus has a dedicated fanbase.","4 people found this helpful."

"Paul Desmond","11 months ago","No story spoilers.

I really wanted to like this game. My enjoyment and opinion of the game started out high, giving it 10/10. Sadly, the more minigames I played, the more I disliked the game. Frustrations were high with the idiotic Condor minigame. The exploration became tedious. The materia rewards simply were not worth it. The game is riddled with minigames required for story progression, which gets tiresome. By this release I do not like what they have done with the summon and materia system. I enjoyed master magic, command, and summon. There is no point in getting any summon in this game except for Bahamut, unless you are going for 100% completion. The summons just don't do enough damage and you can get better ones in a short amount of time. By the time I got Bahamut, I just wanted the game to end (had put in 70 hours already and stopped exploring after Cost del Sol.

Gold saucer was overall a huge disappointment. I could not wait to leave that place. It wasn't even gold in color like the original. The rewards for the minigames weren't incentive enough to continue or even go back there.

Chocobo breeding: I know some hated it. I loved it, and it's gone.

The story, while no spoilers, does do several fake outs which I found tedious and annoying.

Overall, the remake has removed much of what I enjoyed about the original, chocobo breeding being one of those things. Final Attack > Revive is another. Mime materia is another.

I'm not sure if I will play the final one or just watch cutscenes on youtube. It depends if they remove another one of my favorite things to do: fly around in the Highwind.

Frankly, I never understood the hype around FF7. I enjoyed it, but I always felt it was severaly overrated, and it still is. This is clear by trying to expand the game by pausing the story every hour for silly minigames.","7 people found this helpful."

"D Mc","a year ago","The game is gorgeous. Area exploration is good. Feels like 15's engine for the open world. Story is just not the same though. Make sure you try the OG! Minigames and zone exploration reeeeally slow down the pace of the game.

Option to switch parties would have been nice in battle also. They seem to have balanced the battle difficulty a little more in normal. Dynamic mode was an interesting addition. Staggering gimmicks still meh. Almost too many options in battle now, IMO the synergy skills could have been left out and kept the synergy abilities only. Lots of quests, the story is really slowed down because of them. Chadley becomes a little overbearing and annoying with his technology, giving a very Zelda BOTW type vibe to the over world map.

The poor moogles, what did they do to the poor moogles?! 😢 -1 simply for whatever happened to the design choices here lol.

"MegaThefuture","3 weeks ago","Imagine going to your grandma's and she makes you all these foods, all of them are great and tasty but it's just too much and you end up sick and throwing up, without enjoying ANY of them - That's this game. 

Some great content locked behind generic grindfest. 
Remake 1 was much better, it was clear cut and the production was excellent, I wish they did not make an open world because production suffered, all in all open worlds are outdated concept and no longer good, we don't need another UBISOFT game! I hope they cut the crap in part 3. 

The story is badly told and there really is no culmination, even though a very important thing happens at the end, it feels like a 10 year old kid wrote that whole segment with 3 brain cells and zero emotional intelligence, Remake was done better, I don't know if they fired people from their team that did Remake's story, because here the execution was terrible, cringe and as I said, a 10 year old wrote it or someone with emotional development of a 10 year old.

"Kinz Ak","3 months ago","Pros: it's good game for those who love final fantasy 7 OG and the character that came with it Tifa, Clould, Zack etc, obviously its a remake/rebirth of the game so nothing like OG game other than characters. So bare that in mind when playing the game. However, that being said it has a few ups and down moments and nods to OG FF7 and Crisis core games. Story is abit confusing at times but also very deep and more understandable when playing(or watching it again) the 2nd time. 
Cons: Way to many mini games and seemed a bit easy at times beating enemies.

Other: I personally enjoy the whole ff7 rebirth games but probably not the best ff7 game out there. Would I playing again probably not other than the Queens Blood game(one of the many mini games within the game). Am I excited for the next one definitely yes! 

Overall: Rating I would give it a 3.5 out 5.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Ryan Swarts","a year ago","Final Fantasy games have been a staple in my life. In my family's lives. In my friend's lives. Final Fantasy 7 Remake very gently allowed an old man to keep up. Final Fantasy Rebirth was developed with spite. Memorize 1000 mini-game components to break up every moment of joy you might have - if you don't master it, you don't get one of the hundreds of ways to level up. And you'll need to level up because every fight, even on easy, requires a strategy and focus, which I'm sure people like. Be ready to trade out your materia you won't have a chance to level up with every fight, to lose every fight a few times, and to master the fifty different fighting mechanics introduced to make the game more exciting so that each victory can be more fulfilling and real. Exploring the wide world to try and slog through what you can is still a punishment because you must earn your ability to read the realistic landscape and map out courses. 

When you get storyline, acting, music, graphics - all of it is the top-tier loveliness Square has a reputation for. But this game is out of reach for me in a vindictive way. I hate to stop in the middle of the story. I hate to miss the rest of it. But it only enrages and depresses me. I hate this game. And the feeling is mutual.","27 people found this helpful."
"Dante Strife","4 months ago","Google will not let me post my detailed review regarding this game for some odd reason.

Therefore, I'll sum it up to this (mostly spoiler free):

- The game runs poorly on a base PS5 in combination with a 4k television regardless of ""Performance Mode"" or ""Quality Mode"", even after they tried to fix it.

- The open world is cluttered with distracting side activities and mandatory mini games that persist throughout the whole game.

- The main theme tone of this game now features levity that can give Kingdom Hearts a run for its money.

- Rebirth is not a retelling of a beloved, classic story. The ""Remake"" is where it retells the story until the end of part 1, but Rebirth (part 2) is where it changes the story completely, therefore, I can't say that in good faith, it should be called a remake, because it isn't. This should have been stated clearly by Square Enix at the time this game was announced, but something tells me they knew people weren't going to be happy about the multi-verse insert that side rails the beloved, easy to follow, classic, plot line that was the original FF7.

- The complete new story that is Rebirth doesn't deliver on the major plot points and of the consequences that come after, due to the multi-verse that was implemented.

- My final thoughts on this matter is that if they were going to make changes to the original story that is FF7, then they should have just made changes rather than shoehorn the laziest plot device known to man, the multi-verse, where anything is possible, into FF7, basically turning it into a convoluted mess. Otherwise, they should have just stuck to the original story, and gave the majority of the fans what they truly were hoping for, an actual retelling of a beloved, hit classic.","3 people found this helpful."

Loving the story and the scenery so far but have some gripes… First and foremost and probably from growing up with the original, the combat, turn based was a huge part of ff7 and personally believe removing it and going action was a mistake. Next is why are there so many mini games? Its starting to feel like a job, go collect this, now do a mini game, go here, another mini game, talk to this person…oh look another mini game. Then theres Chadly… yes lets put all the good materia in a vr combat sim, reduce the amount of enemies in the wild and remove random encounters aand remove a very crucial aspect…rewards for exploring the world and having to find these items in hidden locations.

I think my only complaint is some of the mini games are ridiculously hard. The Sit ups challenge against Jules specifically, been playing games for 25 years am fairly good but everyone I talk to says that one takes awhile to do.

"Ben Daman","11 months ago","FF7 remake was a masterpiece and polished with obvious test play. Then like everything else the demand drives devs to rush through sequels which leads to broken mechanics, unreal playability and overly repetitive filler quests. 

Remake made you feel easy mode was easy, normal was normal and hard was hard. REBIRTH HOWEVER MAY AS WELL CALL HARD MODE IMPOSSIBLE. 

Countless broken battle after battle. Red dragon was a raging joke, sub bosses like the moss grown adamantois, demon gate, etc. have zero structure to follow in the sense that you can do everything right and yet still get punished for it via unavoidable damage. 

I cannot stand these purchased fake reviews or reviews from people who haven’t even completed the damn game because they lead others to believe this is truly perfection when it is far from it. I’ll give my respects to Remake but not this one. A patch needs to come out soon and correct difficulty, the stupid glitch at gold saucer and not being able to complete the party animal quest. 

Remake made you want to push through the grind because hope of completing it on hard was always within reach and simply tweaking strategies and adapting to move sets got you progression. 

Rebirth is just a complete turn off once you get to the hard mode difficulty in hopes of getting all trophies. 

Gongaga was not an enjoyable experience to traverse around and it feels like the game goes downhill right after that area. 

The mini games are excessive and have no replay value. Some of which aren’t even reasonable with the scores needed to attain the reward (final pirate ships shooter level, or sit up challenge). 

I hope the devs notice this review and stop rushing through everything or at the very least address the issues and patch the game already.

If you’re playing for the sake of the story continuation and absolutely nothing else then you’ll get a decent experience hence the 3 stars

"Thom Ace Reyes","11 months ago","While its story and cinematic moments are great, much like the previous FF7 Remake, it has its few problems. 

Camera: First, the annoying camera wasn't improved at all. Like in Remake, the camera does not clip into walls and instead zooms in when it collides against walls, which could lead to horrible angles, especially in tight spaces. This is applicable to both free roaming and combat.

Controls: The control scheme that they have established in the first game does not translate well into the open-world type environment Rebirth introduces. You cannot freely jump, instead you have to constantly guess which terrain can be climbed on. While sprinting with chocobos, you will undoubtedly get interrupted by obstacles and uneven terrain, most apparent in the Gongaga region. To make this worse, navigating the region is horrible. You cannot have both tracker and minimap active in the UI and there's no waypoint system of any sort (unless you count chocobo sniffing but not really).

That said, it's still an enjoyable game. I'm only halfway through and I've already spent 70 hours, thanks to all the numerous side quests and minigames distracting me from the main story lol. But I hope they improve what I've mentioned above in the next installment.","1 person found this helpful."

I would argue that this is probably the best modern single player FF to come out in over the better part of a decade. First half of the game is fun but I found myself racing to finish the story after chapter 8 due to side quest burnout and minigames.

The game straight up fell off the edge of a cliff for me in the final multiple phase Sephiroth fight. Early boss fight design was great, but these bells and whistles epic battles are brought down hard throughout the later part of the game with frustrating jank mechanics you'd expect from an MMO.

This game simply does not respect your time, knowing you'll spend hours retrying the same mini games, the same ridiculously overtuned fights, watching the same unskippable battle cutsenes, doing the same inane BS in every zone.

I've had enough, im done. Specifically, the battle challenging in both the arena and chadley you're forced to do on hard, but it's not even challenging, it's straight up asinine content designed to force you to fail and do it over since they don't tell you the enemies you'll face until you get to them, instead of helping you succeed. 

I've completed so much of them and each one frustrated the hell out of me, and after I just killed a mindlfayer and quezalcoatl together, the game throws an insanely strong bandersnatch at you along with a king zu that repeatedly tries to one-shot-party-wipe you an, more often than not, succeeds because you have to delete the huge healthpools of its wings. Oh, and to top that off, not knowing I needed anti petrified means I'm guaranteed a loss just to have to do it all again. And that's how EVERY SINGLE HARD MODE ""CHALLENGE"" WORKS. 

F this game, F Nomura, and F Square Enix most of all. People have better things to do, and I sincerely hope you don't use the sunk cost fallacy to waste so much of your time like I did mine.

The mini games are too much, they are a blight on this game. 

There’s a sit up mini game you have to win and the control scheme is idiotic. The more I play this game the more I dislike it. 

The main story is a fraction of my time spent playing this game. It’s more fluff than fantasy.

The zones looks amazing, but there not a lot you can do in them. a few mobs here and there along with the same set of objectives you do every zone. 

6 towers. You literally climb up them and press triangle.

6 combat assignments. Fight some enemies and kill them by usually pressuring and staggering the enemies.

Find 3 crystals. When you find them press some buttons in a particular order. (This game is full of these types of mechanics).

Lifespirings, when you find them press triangle 3 times.

Take some photos.

find a mushroom house, run into some moogles so they run away from you and go into their base. Just directional movement, maybe you will use L2.

Find some chocobo stops, hold triangle.

Can’t believe people are giving this 5 stars.

The only challenge is the mini games and it is only a challenge because of the control schemes. These games with normal control schemes would be much obtainable for everyone.

"Dwight Schrute","a year ago","Like what many have already stated, the writers failed to understand what made ff7 such a great game. I felt dirty after playing Remake, it like it was disrespecting 97’s version by trying to view it as a true remake. Rebirth felt similar but at least I got to see a good job of the world building aspect.

I feel bad for the developers because this could have meant more than just a money grab cash-in reboot of a classic. Why did they have to change so much, at least leave their personalities out of it, change tthe combat but why take death out and replace it with multiverse bs - it’s not a remake anymore it’s a b-list imitation at best. The changes made to this remake serve to try and make everyone happy and end up making it generic anime game. The cutest, teenage grunts and silly noises are cringe worthy, the multiverse ghost people keeping anyone from truly dying, the broken difficulty options (choice between auto pilot or increasing the healthy bars of enemies).

 The combat mechanic is decent compared to remake, graphics and world are about the only reason to “revisit” this game. I enjoy seeing the world come to life from what I’ve played in polygons so many times prior but the cringe changes and silly writing makes it feel more like a Persona game than the mature game from 97. 

I would give it a forgettable generic 3/5 as a stand alone game if I didn’t know it was attempting to be a remake of one of the best video games of all time. The graphics are good, the combat is ok. The story tone, voice acting and writing are all cliche and silly. Nothing close to the original. Yes it sounds like a harsh review but you had one job and perfect source material.

"Joey Ricciardi","11 months ago","Best Game I have played and did not get bored after 80 hours. They really did this remake justice. What an amazing game. A Masterpiece imo. I can only imagine how much better the 3rd game will be! Because rebirth is 10X better than remake. 

I see alot of people complaining about the ""mini games"" lol which I find hilarious. I thought they were all great and fun. The Gold Saucer was a major part of the fun in the original ff7. Not to mention Queensblood. I never played the card games in any game before. But once I got the hang of Queensblood I became hooked. 

This is one of the best games ever imo! PERIOD.","1 person found this helpful."

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is kind of Final Fantasy 7 and kind of not:

The Remake-series of Final Fantasy 7 is a modern reimagination.
The graphics and game mechanics are great and it's definitely fun to play.
In some cases SquareEnix stayed loyal to the original storyline but all in all you can see that the developers are divided between sticking to the original and reimagining the whole story.
As someone who played the original jRPG in the 90s on the PSX I must say I am really disappointed.
The Multiverse approach is unecessarily complicated and the game starts to look like a Japanese attempt to copy of the Avengers-Movie series. 
It's not really clear who is dead or alive - who is living in which dimension and who doesn't.
The original game had a simple concept of life and death to which one could relate better since in the real world a loss is permanent.

The game is fun to play, the battle system and the story are interesting none the less.
The game music is incredible.

But for the love of god, SquareEnix: stop with the Multiverse already and stay true to one of the best videogames ever made!","6 people found this helpful."
"Zoltán Kacsó","8 months ago","I played ""Final Fantasy VII Rebirth"" and it’s amazing! The graphics are stunning and the combat is super engaging. They’ve added new story content that fits perfectly with the original, so it feels nostalgic and fresh at the same time. Some open-world parts get a bit repetitive and a few performance hiccups, but overall, it's a fantastic continuation of the FF7 story. It's worth checking out if you're a fan!","Was this review helpful to you?"
"aaron gomez","a year ago","The combat is fine, but many of the fights drag on because the enemy health bars are needlessly huge.

The story has changed. Apparently the events at the end of FF7 REMAKE introduced multiverses and it just brings confusion. Zach's dead in one universe, but fine in the other. Dyne's final scene is screwed up by plugging in shinra soldiers in a lame attempt to make it less intense than the original and changing his entire final words to alter his story. Worst of all, Aerith's final scene from the original is remade in a poorly done way that leaves you with no clear understanding of what is actually happening. You're not able to celebrate or grieve because it's unclear what's going on. Basically 25 hours of the game is filler and it shows.

The open world activities are bland. You climb of bunch of towers, scan of bunch of stuff, and find chests.

The side quests are laughable, being chores and lacking excitement. You go there and kill that, you dig for stuff with your chocobo to take to an NPC, or you drag this chicken food to lure a chicken back to it's place (an actual sidequest)

Square Enix really messed up an iconic story and I'm sure it'll be worse in part 3 when it comes out several years from now..","5 people found this helpful."
"Maysin Bell","9 months ago","I bought the OG day 1. I'm waiting for the remakes completion, but I'm spoiling all of it. 

So far, I find the story itself very sanitized. Exchanging the dark, emotional toll of the original for a modernized, multiverse twist that I still do find very compelling to experience. Nomura has been able to tie in answers to age old questions as well as create something new.

I'm ultimately nothing short of amazed in how absolutely beautiful the game is. The characters are so over the top, I find myself lost in YT videos. 

I'm waiting for the trilogy to be complete. Of it releases in a master version I'll buy that. I'm dying on tue inside to play.

Aerith's VA has been absolutely perfect. Aerith is perfect. She was everything I imagined her to be since the OG. This goes to many of the characters except for Zack.. and Cloud with all of Cody's roaring. Like FFS Cody stop.

I can also see why Vincent and Cid are not playable. We are about to get some FF16 kind of gameplay in the last game. I got a feeling it's going to have an additional battle sequence.

"Dreamfast with Me","a year ago","Something i'm noticing about a lot of these 5 star reviews, is that they were posted only a few days after the game came out. You will see many posts start like ""I'm about half way through..."" or ""Just started chapter 4 and i love it!"" ect. Normally, you finish things before reviewing them. And this is precisely the problem. The game may be flooded with glowing reviews, but they seem to be from people who haven't finished the game yet and perhaps a few bots. So here are the honest thoughts of someone who has actually completed it:

The game itself is actually amazing. They really did a brilliant job of bringing the characters, world, music, environments and story to life. 80% of the game is fantastic and was absolutely goty material. That is, right up until the last couple hours. 

Unfortunately, the game just completely falls apart with a very bizarre multiverse concept they introduced. Instead of watching a beautiful, emotional ending, you're just bewildered as you witness a convoluted mess. And that was not how i wanted to feel.

I think the bigger question is WHY do all this to begin with? If they had just made a more straightforward story that adhered to the og, hardly anyone would be complaining. I get they were trying something more complex, but I don’t think 7 was the game for it. 8 definitely, but not 7. A majority of gamers—most of whom are from the og crowd—were just expecting a simple remake, and now we have to watch Youtube videos to have everything explained to us. That’s where the gripe is stemming from. It’s not that the ideas aren’t interesting, it’s just that too much change is not a good thing. A generous 3/5.","10 people found this helpful."

Most of this game is absolute brilliance. I've never seen anything with such a high standard and production value as this beast of a beauty. Nevertheless there are some things that really stick out like a sore thumb: the Moogle hunts are downright terrible, some mini games do not have the level of control as it should be and the first two thirds of the 13th chapter is some of the worst padding in video game history.

"Kevin Nguyen","11 months ago","I am nearly finished with the game and there were a lot of things that affected the experience and gameplay for me. 

I have played FF7 Remake and liked the way they did that, it was very unique and I think it was the overall better game. But for FF7 Rebirth and their whole new open-world system, it ruined that experience. 

1. If you have played Horizon Forbidden West, they have practically followed the same map/open-world gameplay as theirs, which I am not a big fan of. 

2. There is this one AI robot that ruins the gameplay experience, once you explore through the game...you'll see why. There are several regions that you'll have to go through as well which he will guide you through. 

3. The game goes through several sudden chapter changes compared to FF7 Remake, which will throw you off a bit and maybe the entire story. Again, you'll see once you play through it. 

Other than that, they kept everything the way it was. The combat system, the story, the characters, and added a lot more new things to the game. I would strongly recommend playing FF7 Remake first before going into this, it'll just make everything more confusing if you don't.","1 person found this helpful."
"Chase Gaetze","a year ago","I honestly don't know how this game is rated so high. I mean maybe if the game was in Japanese the tutorials would be better. But having never played FF7, I played the remake and thought everything was polished nicely. This game is just down right terrible at times. The lighting in caves just goes completely black for the first 50 ft in the cave, can't even see your character. In the remake you had to do like a pull up challenge this time it's sit ups but instead of using triangle circle blah blah they use all the trigger buttons knowing the controls get slightly harder to press every time. The combat simulator there's times where it'll steal your camera just to swollow your character with unblockable instead of allowing you to dodge it. They put some of the most obnoxious monsters together. 3 that stay underground the whole fight only doing red attacks to your characters. And you have to just get lucky to hit one with another character as it pops out. Or another where the AI is so freaking stupid you put something to sleep just for the AI to continue fighting it to wake it up. This game deserves like a 5/10.
The open world aspect is like 3 activities that you just repeat for the 100+ hours of the game","2 people found this helpful."

I just finished the game on Normal mode today, and I can appreciate the devs making some of the final bosses really challenging, but I don’t know. Too hard and too much of a time commitment.

The only bad ones is in nimbihim or however you spell that towns name. It's chapter 11 and most of the time your playing as caitsit through most of the character and mini games for that chapter.

Sure there are highly subjective aspects I don't like (sepheroths continuous appearances, zach playing a bigger role, ect), and even still iblike these things because they add a depth that was not there in the original.

They re-did the look of some of the towns but the towns still resemble how they looked in the original. Imo they just upgraded the way the towns look and added in more advanced electronical technology which makes sense.

However, the gameplay is not very good. Battle system is decent enough, but there is little influence over character development with a very poor level tree that offers almost no noticable growth from beginning to end. Weapons seem to do nothing for the way your characters play (more for appearance than actual useful) and the side missions and map missions are EXTREMELY repetitive. I found logging into the game to be a chore after a while. I felt no reward for any of my efforts, and after 70 hours of gameplay, the final boss was a mess! You have no ability to arrange material or plan ahead, and have to start a series of 5 or so fights over if you fail the last one and need to make changes to characters. This remake has been a mess since they decided to split it into 3 games. How disappointing! They are milking the shit out of this game that could have been made into 2 games if necessary. If only they did not try to add 40+ hours of useless, boring side tasks, the game could have been a solid, single remake.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The technical depth in the combat system is here as well. For those expecting a mostly linear and simple experience or struggle with the more technical aspects of combat may struggle.

"Peak Gammon","11 months ago","As a fan of the original FF7 I gave ""Remake"" a chance and was disappointed by how tedious and boring it was, so much so I said I wouldn't play any more FF series.

Anyway, I got suckered in again as ""Rebirth"" looked promisingly like the game I expected from ""Remake"" (a straight FF7 remake, but improved graphics etc).

I was wrong, and they made it worse that ""Remake"".

There is a lot of fan service attempts, some of which are well done, but it feels secondary to the main game, which is very linear and full (and I mean full) of pointless mini games (which they force you to play as part of the game, and will no doubt be released as a card game merch in due course).

The final battle is ridiculously long and has 12 separate stages which require a strategic deployment of materia because there are different parties throughout the 12 stages.

The final stage is tedious and ridiculously unbalanced, and you have to watch a 2 minute cut scene each time you replay it.

A few retries quickly sucked the joy out of the game and made me resolve to never play a FF or SE title again.

And the ending is not worth playing the game for.

"Nathan Scott","a year ago","This is a masterpiece of a game. However it severly mishandled the ending of the game in what is supposed to be one of the most pivotal moments. I won't say anymore details as I don't want to spoil.

The final chapter is rushed, messy underdeveloped and needlessly convoluted. It leaves a very sour taste in your mouth.

Aside from that, gameplay is smooth fun and very varied. Lots of mini games throughout the experience add to keeping things fresh. The action tactical combat makes a return and it is more improved with many ways to customise your builds and party set ups.

For the majority of the game the pacing is great which is an impressive feat given that it took 100hrs for me to complete. As soon as things started feeling like they need to be ending, they ended.

The story and characters are fantastic (ignoring the train wreck that is the final chapter).

Music is absolutely amazing. Fantastic music throughout the experience.

The graphics and artstyle are stunning, some minor pop in issues and texture issues but as a whole picture the game can be breathtakingly pretty.

The game is an amazing achievement. With an experience that will have you laughing, crying, raging and everything in between. Such a shame that the final chapter is very poorly executed. In another title I would not recommend a game with this ending. 

However, aside from the ending this is a masterpiece and well worth your money. Still extremely disappointed by its end.","1 person found this helpful."

There's too much side quest (Cards, anyone? Me neither.) and not enough character development. Cid and Vincent are so watered down, they may as well have been cut all together. Spoiler alert for the rest of the review: Why bring back Biggs just to do a whole lot of nothing with him? Once you get past the girth of filler content, the storyline makes sense to a point. Then you hit the last couple of hours, and the way that the creators decide to toy with the timeline goes from clever to nonsensical so fast that by the time you reach a place where you could feel big emotions, the only big emotion left is confusion. We had this great opening with Zack and we saw the rest of the group unconscious on choppers. We think they'll circle back to that at some point. Then there's the skewing of realities at the end, and it's like they abandoned the opening altogether in favor of what? I felt like I was watching a movie where the studio had too much say and everything went to pieces.

This is an action-adventure game, and any time the camera is in motion it's terrible. The 30 fps only looks good when you're completely still.. the second you move it's complete studder and ruins the immersion of the game. If you switch to their performance modes, the graphics take such a massive downgrade that's it's like an early PS4 game. It's obvious they didn't take the time to optimize the game properly, yet have the audacity to charge over $70 for this..

It's clear as day to me now that a lot of these ""perfect"" reviews are paid for. There is no way a AAA title like Final Fantasy 7 should be released in this state. A PS5-exclusive struggling to maintain graphical fidelity and/or FPS at 60 FPS is an embarrassment in 2024.

Zero passion. It is hard to play this game for more than an hour without getting drained.
I went back and played the original FF7 and was instantly drawn in far better than this. It is truly sad what they have done to one of the best Final Fantasy stories.","2 people found this helpful."
"Ryan Y.","6 months ago","Horribly Imbalanced: The dragon early in the game is way too difficult compared with some much later bosses. 

Disastrous Dynamic Mode: While it's supposed to adjust the difficulty level based on the player's performance, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Criminal Normal Mode: It was anything BUT 'normal'. You practically live on potions and spend way too much time using them. 

Incredibly Difficult Final Boss: The final boss has like a million phases, and the very last one is incredibly difficult on Normal Mode. 'Had to go back and power up four times and still had to fight him like 50 times to finally beat him. 

Challenge is one thing, but when you make a game so incredibly difficult for what it should be on Normal mode and leave the player unsatisfied in the end, that's when you know you screwed up.","1 person found this helpful."
"vash Roberts","4 months ago","Huge fan of the original FF7 game,  been looking forward to a remake of the game for years. Played FF7 remake, it was ok, not great. Was hoping rebirth would be great since it happens outside of Midgar.

No spoilers:

Graphically the game is amazing, the world really looks great.

The combat system is absolutely horrible compared to the original, half the time it feels like you party is doing nothing. 

Seems everytime there is a boss coming up, the party gets broken up and you are locked with limited options.

Crafting system is just annoying, wish they just had it like before, as you move through the story, new items are up for sale in new towns.

Summons are not so helpful, well unreliable,  most of the time the summon bar comes up once you stagger an enemy,  other times it doesn't. 

Mini games, there are so many of them and a lot of them are horrible.

Then there is a lot of content that is stuck on hard mode and only 10% or less of players actually get to see it.

I'll no doubt get the final part when it comes out, but have low hopes and not looking forward to it. 

Don't get me started on Chadley.

Hopefully square won't do this when they remake FF9.

But Graphically it looks great,  mostly the only reason why the score isn't lower.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Chantra","7 months ago","This game is disappointing. I dont recommend it. There is too much filler content that adds nothing to the story other than a distraction. Then they have mandatory minigames with wonky controls. I dreaded having to do them and every section has one.

Every single boss fight has a stupid power-up (sometimes multiple) that triggered when hp reached a certain level. It always disrupted the flow of battle. The battle system is just poorly done. It relies on blocking and dodging but there's so much screen flash and wonky camera movement making it impossible in many cases to even use the mechanic. The Sphere grid is worthless. Not to mention the misleading retry feature that could for some reason erase hours of gameplay.

The story is for some reason forgettable even though I played the original. The story loves to get side-tracked for some pointless minigame section. It just feels like some of the new story elements (that feel like filler episodes) kind of just gets shoehorned into the game.

DNF. I made it half-way and I messed up on one of the retry screens, which deleted three hours of gameplay somehow. I just can't bring myself to redo the section as I was already struggling to play the game.","1 person found this helpful."
"Zack Metcalf","8 months ago","After reviewing a few of the other reviews…. I’m facing facts with myself. No I have not finished all the FF games I’ve played. Yes, I have enjoyed FF7 games of the retro and many more in the early 2000s. With that said, REMAKE started with something beautifully intact. Figured it’d be a different timeline/ new secrets and not disappointment. 

Respectfully, those of you that have come up with these ridiculous ideas of throwing in a lot of things as though it’s another Fortnite franchise…. You’ve literally hurt the entire purpose for there being 5-star ratings on this game. Sure, things didn’t go so well with the predecessor of Square Enix seeing as he left the company. But this? All these random things as far as odd jobs don’t need so much. The Final Fantasy makes me want to replay the retro version just to feel like I haven’t been betrayed. I’m pushing myself not to sell this game back as I’m at Chapter 10.","2 people found this helpful."
"Vexel G.","a year ago","All this multiverse storyline destroyed what could have been a terrific experience! They also added a lot of silly stuff like the endless boring missions from that annoying Chad boy. The cherry on top of all the disappointment was really that last fight and how they ruined one of the key moments from the original. If you are a fan, you know what I'm talking about. They completely killed the emotion and gave us confusion. Also, pushing dead Zack down our throats was annoying as well and felt too forced. One last thing I can't help to say, they made Cid's existence on the team completely pointless. At least on the original we get to know his story and all his reasons to stay with the team. On this game, he is just there and not even playable. The game has few positive aspects sure, but the negative surpassed them by far...

"Sasaki","3 weeks ago","Too many side missions and mini games. Granted I didn’t have to do it, but I bought the collectors edition that was worth $300+ so I like to get ma moneys worth. They should just make a separate game filled with side missions and mini games and focus more on the story💀⚰️.  The side missions felt like a chore even when it was part of the main story. I really wanted to like it, but it just felt redundant. 
Besides that the story was ok it felt like they just crammed all of it in the end. It was kinda confusing too per usual and to be expected. The combat was great though instead of having 2 ATBs it’d be better to have 3. The magic could flow a little better during combat like instead of standing still to you can move around while being locked onto the enemy to make it flow with the combat. Though that would be like the classic turned based, but I digress. The music in the beginning was ok, but it got really good towards the end. Though not as good as other FFs. Graphically the game is gorgeous.
I understand not everyone will agree as no one is obligated to agree or disagree, but overall the game was ok. 
I spent 155 hours on this game doing almost every side mission and only getting 68% of the trophies. I’d say about 5-10 hours is of actual story. 💀⚰️","1 person found this helpful."

"Natale Meritz-Saccente","a year ago","It's reassuring to know many feel as I do, as an OG FFVII player, that Rebirth is just not as exciting and was overly hyped due to the original story and nature of the game. Rebirth doesn't have a story. It's literally a series of mashed up side quests, Chadley speaking, and mini games you *have* to complete in order to continue on with the story or open up more of the world map. It's frustrating how after either leaving or entering a new area, you have to partake in some sort of shooting mini game (Corel) or are forced to duel using block characters (Gold Saucer) or QB just showing up whenever they have the opportunity. Mini games as a whole used to be optional with an exception to a select few that were in the OG game but so few and spread out didn't feel as daunting of a task. I am not having fun nor am I enjoying my now 35+ hour dedication to this awful game. I'm sorry..I hate it. I'm disappointed in the writers for essentially rewriting KH3 which was just as convoluted and nonsensical. It's just not it. Not worth it. Don't waste your time.","7 people found this helpful."
"Juan Pimentel","6 months ago","Only reason why I play the remake and rebirth is for nostalgic reasons. I came from the original FF7 from 1997. I was 13 years old. There’s many things they changed and twisted the story a bit for both remake and rebirth. Some are fun and some are repetitive. Square enix took ubi-soft approach on the open world for rebirth. Chadley is freaking annoying having to interrupt you every 5-10 min. You do the same for every region just to make the game longer. While some of these are optional but there are mini games you have to play to just continue the main story. The card game is fun and the fort condor game is fun but the rest I could care less for. Too many bloating and fillers. The open world for this  is bland and the design feels artificial compare to Ghost Of Tsushima open world is beautiful. They could have at least made it epic with weather change and moving bushes, leaves. I like the remake more than the rebirth. But it’s not a bad game if it wasn’t ff7 then I would have given it a 2-3 star. There are way too many unnecessary upgrade options as well. Couldn’t even keep it simple.","Was this review helpful to you?"

This is NOT a Remake. 

This is a disgrace to one of the greatest stories ever told. 

As a stand alone game, I don’t think it’s that bad (certainly not a 1 star) but to call this “FF7” is really disrespectful. 

It’s not in sync with the true story. 
So much left out and changed that I’m sure they will cram into the last game - and do even less justice. 

It’s trying too hard to be everything at once.

There is one problem I have with this trilogy though and that is part three. Allow me to explain. FFVII Remake came our for PS4 and later a PS5 version was released. Rebirth is PS5 only so anyone who has Remake on PS4 can't continue the story unless they upgrade to a PS5. My concern is that by the time the final installment is released, we will have the PS6. Question is, will the third game be able to run on the PS5 or will it be PS6 exclusive? What would be the point of playing a trilogy on three different console?","Was this review helpful to you?"

Lacks the magic of the original game which is disappointing.

Chadley is so annoying.
A lot of quests are pointless and repetitive.
No submarine 
No snowboarding
Would prefer to find summons throughout the world as in the original.
Weapons are rubbish and so is the upgrading system.

Obviously the graphics are better. But no where near as this remake of the iconic classic succeeded. It is a good game for newbies. But fails massively at giving the original fans what we’ve been waiting for’  for the last 25 years. 

The queens blood mini game started out to be good and addictive but turns out to be a stupid game when trying to complete it because it’s basically just guessing where cards should go with no real meaning to what they do just becomes a game of random guessing and no logical strategy, again it’s annoying

Overall it’s a disappointment. Will not be remembered or replayed it’s so repetitive that you find yourself getting bored and just not caring for any of the cutscenes, and find yourself holding the triangle button just to skip through it!!!!

"Davee Dave (Pan Desheng)","a month ago","I loved the Remake and imo it's a strong contender for the best game of the year during that time. Rebirth it's still as good but there's definitely something you wish it was better. 

1. Smoother movement is something i wish it would be better. Especially with like uneven terrain, Chocobo just stops randomly as if it hit an obstacle but when you press the terrain action button, you just jump over it.

2. I liked the Punisher Mode in Remake but I don't know why they would change the moveset, especially to something like the current one. It's not that it's not good but i just prefer the previous one.

3. standard launch problems, Stutter and etc. 

For some reason in Rebirth it felt like, 30% main story, 20% Side quest, 30% Exploration and 100% Chadley bytch.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Andrew Hernandez","a year ago","Though the story may not be as well written as the orginal Final Fantasy 7 on PlayStation. The story still hits its marks. It doesn’t take its time to introduce you to the open world. Once your past chapter 1 everything is open. The characters in this game are fantastic and well written. (Seeing Aerith, Tifa, and Yuffie were some of the highlights in conversations.) You pay attention to the game you can catch these little Easter eggs in the dialogue. The gameplay is fantastic. You start off on the weaker side but once you start developing and building your team. The combat opens up.

My few downsides. The in game music can be a bit too much at times. Sometimes taking away from a cut scene. Sure you can lower the in game music but still the audio can be all over the place. There are a lot of mandatory mini games in game that take away from the story beats but other than that. This is a fantastic game. I would give it a 9 out of 10.

So far, good story but the gameplay itself feels like it's more a collection of minigames than it is about the core combat and exploration. The card game, stealthing chocobos, the tower thing from remake, the frog thing, now I have to put together a dance troupe?!!! Dude, so far this is not the ""masterpiece"" people are making it out to be, it's like a giant quick time event. As much as the story has been decent. I'm NOT HAVING FUN. The combat is pretty decent...when you actually get to do it...but half the time you aren't. The outerworld areas aren't really as open and ripe for exploration as they first appear.  They literally added a character that's more annoying than Chadley, to the point that Chadley flat out says she's annoying. And yeah maybe you can turn both of them off, but why is n she even in there? It's not ""terrible"".  It's just...not...great and...not...fun for a lot of the play time so far.

After hitting a wall with a very stupidly designed box throwing task when I finally decided to push through on the story because there's way too much side content and open world chores, I get hit with mini game number 23 or who knows. This was NOT the right thing to do, I'm sorry. I'm extremely disappointed with the total lack of restraint that was present in Remake. They could have cut half the open world and mini games and it would just be a better game. A lot of these things just have no value. 
-----
It’s hard for me to give this less than 3 stars because clearly a lot of work went into this game. I just don’t care about the work they did. I was hoping for some treatments of the major towns like Midgar, not this open world fetch quest boredom. Paired with endless mini games, my god, I don’t feel like I’m playing Final Fantasy. The fact that there is a part with a dolphin that is a mini game for no reason was a huge turnoff for me. 

Crushes me because I absolutely loved Remake and wanted more of a game like that. Not a Ubisoft fetch quest fiesta. It’s just boring. It’s a beautiful and boring open world. Chadley was already too much in Remake and now he has a more annoying companion like, why. Why do these two characters who don’t matter have so, so many voice lines.

The story basically never takes itself seriously enough and too much of the dialogue is cringe compared to the first game. I love how they have added so much to do, but, I almost feel it's too much, and multiple side quests become repetitive and boring. The traversal is also slow, and the basic combat is not as in depth as I was wishing for, yet still tries to be more complicated than it should be, with synergy moves and new skill trees. One good thing is the graphics and open world, but the repetitive, boring mini games and awful side quests ruin the feel of the game. And as mentioned the dialogue is too cringe, yeah the first remake had it's moments of cringe, but every line in this game is cheesy, it feels like a kids anime with the writing.

"cheesemanavenue","8 months ago","The original FF7 for the PS1 is one of my favorite games. Since the plot is mostly consistent with the original, I can’t give less than 4 stars. However, there is a lot I did not enjoy about this game. The fact that most of the side content is optional prevented me from ranking it lower.

The mini games are fun but there are so many that it becomes very tedious trying to complete them all. In general, there is too much side content to this game. It becomes repetitive trying to complete the world Intel which is mostly the same in each region. Once you finally think you have completed a mini game, a hard mode appears requiring you to complete the mini game all over again. Most of the side content is optional, but it is a massive part of the game to skip.

The battle system is good but not great. It can be very difficult, especially the optional challenges. It requires a decent mix of skill and character/Materia setup, not much strategy required.

Overall, if you decide to try and finish all the side content i would rank the game 3/5 due to how tedious and frustrating it can be to complete everything. However, if you are willing to skip things the plot and core gameplay are still enjoyable.","Was this review helpful to you?"

One star for making it open world. It was fun and beautiful exploring, but lacked things to actually do. Final Fantasy 15 had much more adventure. You could fish, camp, quest, and find treasures along the way. Rebirth felt more like an arcade game you had to complete instead of explore. 
Negative one star for Yuffie, as I found myself skipping through most of the dialogue with her. I did not find her voice pleasing, nor what she had to say. So I lost a lot of the story line, unfortunately.
Negative 2 stars for creating a character most people won’t beat and will give up through 70% of the game.

When I first played FF7 I was hooked. However, I never understood the love of Aerith. I was thankful she died and we could move on from her silly dialogue and interactions with Cloud. Tifa had always been best girl, she was the girl next door after all.

But I never understood the hype around FF7. I found it mediocre at best. I didn't hate it or love it, but there were many elements that I loved.

I spent hours in Gold Saucer and breeding chocobos. Sadly, breeding has been completely removed and Gold Saucer rewards are so bad I don't see the point in playing. Summons are watered down. No more master materia.

The fact that this is getting such rave reviews is beyond me. It's 70% mini games, crawling, and walking without battles.

What happened to Red's voice? Seriously that was the dumbest thing ever. Then I was forced to listen to him sounding like a muppet compared to a cool, seasoned, warrior that he actually is.

Plain and simple: I enjoy the storytelling when they actually tell a story.  However the sheer volume of mandatory mini games detracts so much.  I'm not opposed to mini games and things of the like, something to break the tension, give the audience a breather from some heavy ideas/themes.  That doesn't happen here.  It's one pointless mini game after another with a dusting of the story.  In short, if they wanted to make a FF7 party game, go with all the mini games.  Here, it actively and consistently destroys any story attempting to be told.  It feels like they were nervous/unsure about what and how they wanted to tell the story so instead we're following the ramblings of a child reciting a bedtime story from memory.

I think the only time the game shines is in the main plotline and the several character interactions. Outside of that, are all just fillers (and that's like 70-80% of the game!). The open world is really just bland, like typical Ubisoft open world (probably worst is some areas like in Gongaga and Cosmo Canyon). And they really pump the cringy ""anime moments"" meter to the max in this🤣. I've lost count the number of times I cringe at the writing😆.

Personally, I think FF7 remake was better. In Rebirth, there're some aspects that were 9/10s, but then there're other aspects that were 5/10s. Overall, Rebirth is just a solid 7/10 game for me, nothing beyond that 💁🏻.

I take FF16 any day over Rebirth🤣.","1 person found this helpful."
"Sophie Mallory","10 months ago","As a long final fantasy fan I was absolutely dissapointed by this game. I hate queen's blood, I couldn't even win the first one and I feel like I'm sabotaging my level by not completing those. The chadley Intel is soooo boring, I am sick and tired of running around looking for the same stuff. It is too long before you get any dialogue and get progression. I don't like how you can't manually upgrade weapons, crafting is pointless, don't understand the point of pressuring an enemy. Battles are very hard and punishing. I hate those sewer guys too, don't understand why they are back...and the cloaked guys make no sense

The graphics are stunning, as always. I love the battle system and voice acting is on point but those good things make up a small percentage.

What a waste of money, I am truly and utterly disappointed. I waited 4 years for this garbage!

Found myself playing final fantasy x afterwards and felt more satisfaction","1 person found this helpful."

"Michael Varela","2 months ago","So I recently played final fantasy 16 and to be honest it was decent at best. Ended up returning it. So as a huge final fantasy 7 fan. I beat the original one on PS. Probably nine times, and then replayed the PC port and put a hundred hours on it. I also played final fantasy reborn. And thought that was a really good game. However, while playing this game I asked myself the question. If this wasn't final fantasy if we didn't have nostalgia if it wasn't a game that I bought because I played it from the past and it's a remake. Would I be playing this game? And the answer to the question is no. Probably not. It's so repetitive with the fighting from jrpg. It's just a copy and paste. New characters but exactly same system for everything. And for some reason Sony decided to switch random things up for no reason. It's like you could have just kept it consistent. I don't know. I gave this game a seven and I'll give it four stars just cuz there's really nothing bad about it. But there's really nothing great about it and most things are just decent. Also, I always enjoyed the grinding of fighting in the original. And this is like you have to literally seek out fights. As much as I want to sit and watch people talk, I would rather just watch a movie on Netflix which wouldn't have costed me $40. I don't know. I think if you never played the original you would most likely like this game better. Or if you're really not honest with yourself about how good this game is which it's not great. But it is good, and it adds a bunch of stupid stuff.","Was this review helpful to you?"

That and how the story teases you that certain characters will change their destiny, but only to snatch it all away and serve you a big bowl of disappointment and square expects you to love it.

Idk. Maybe not for me or maybe remake made an impression that things will change now. If you are into non stop mini games then this is for you.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Minigames are required to advance, chocobo wrangling (also a minigame) and riding are required much more than the original. The storyline is easily forgettable in the midst of Chadley butting in to tell you everything about everywhere. They added team attacks. And crafting....we didn't need crafting, we just wanted a jump button. I honestly am not sure if I will finish this or not. It's like they tried to take 1 element from every other game and force them into the main quest. Sorry.","5 people found this helpful."

You can’t follow the actual story because the are a lot of side quest that you have to complete in order to be able to beat the enemies.

Most of the plot unfolds after chapter 11 of 14. Overall it was a very mild experience even though the graphics were insane.

And the open world repetitive checklist trash quests are obnoxious making your journey a boring slog with a few cool moments slipped in.

"Chris Maynard","2 weeks ago","I loved remake and I'm not a FF fan by any margin. I was confident in this game. Unfortunately, there is so much fluff and so many ""activities,"" I haven't had a slog like this in a long time. It was painful. Many are optional, but the world is fairly empty without them. Further, there is typically not much reward for doing the activities, except maybe a pair of earrings that allow you to use a spell you already had 3 materia of 3 hours ago. The story is obviously trying to justify the time it's taking. It's a lot of the same stuff and it seems like much of it was unnecessary. I think if I went into this thinking it was a sort of spinoff, I could've been more into it. However, the game does not respect your time and it made me lose faith in the developer for the third entry. I couldn't stand slogging through this game, but that's my personal feelings and the game is well made, to be fair. No glitches whatsoever for me. That damned chocobo song is still playing in my head and I haven't touched the game in weeks. A bit juvenile, all of it.","Was this review helpful to you?"

For not being as linear, dull, easy, string of mashing and somehow just walking through the game just to get to the next cool cutscene. (Looking at you FF16) I give it a 2nd star. However they need to find a style of combat that's actually enjoyable.

The combat is still mostly just a mash-fest of trying to build up stun then combo of super moves. The areas were none to exciting to explore or navigate. Gear progression is still boring, found the card minigame and story to be the best part of the game.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Cait sith box throwing, insufferable gongaga map, stupid chadley intel gathering. Not sure with the idea of altering the original storyline that captured the hearts of ff7 fans.

I absolutely have my complaints, but they're the kinds of complaints a Star Wars guy makes when he says something like ""you see, Tie Fighters are made of quadranium and should be able to reflect an attack of that scale"".... fanboy nerdboy complaints.

To the layman, this game just hits. I haven't felt a sense of wonder or an engagement with the cast like this since Witcher 3.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"B B","a year ago","honestly. Not that good, combat is flashy but is repetitive. Just have to mash square for the most part. Full of annoying mini games and wanna be puzzles. Open world is just open, not lively at all, no motivation to explore to the left or right. Skill tree is uninspiring. It got to the point I just randomly selected any “upgrade”. Weapons are whatever as well. Just a underwhelming experience all together. Not game of the year contender, not a modern masterpiece. People praise it because of the final fantasy name, and of all things FF7.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Moments were cringy and often felt forced to add past characters.  The ending battle was long and felt too similar to remake.  
The combat is always fun.  I wish I streamlined the story.  20 hrs of story surrounded by 70 hrs of Bs just drowned it out.","Was this review helpful to you?"

On top of that, the amount of detail in the world, while good in a few parts, are mostly visual clutter, like there's no need to add patches of bumpy rocks in every single land, there's no need to add tall grass everywhere, especially on built floors which makes no sense.

enemies especially bosses and summons  feel twice as tanky and take twice as long to beat than they did in part 1 and also do double damage and as a ""feature"" added side content so you can unlock nerfs to the challenge/fight of unlocking summons

synergy abilities feel like useless filler content  combat overall once again in the subject of unlocking summons feels like a chore  rather than optimizing gear it boils down to grinding out materia levels  to try again and if you fail well go and do the 1 - 3 side content shrines that unlocks ""easier"" versions of the fight","8 people found this helpful."

The game felt extremely long and boring, with a storyline that made no sense. I was lost from start to finish and still can't make sense of the plot. The original Final Fantasy 7 was much better; this remake is a terrible game.","Was this review helpful to you?"

2. Open-world is very repetitive.

If you like button mashing and one move wipes where you fight a boss for 10 minutes and mis time ONE dodge than this game is for you. The story doesn't redeem the combat and the mini games/sidequests are more infuriating than rewarding. This is by the far the worst FF game I have ever played, and I played 15.","1 person found this helpful."
