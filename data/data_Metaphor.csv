"Fork","5 months ago","Easily one of the best games Atlus has ever put out! It's definitely my personal favorite. Everything about it just hits the right spot, the amazing music which I would put up there with the masterful work that is Nier: Automata's OST. The gameplay, while mostly the same is refined and some of the best combat they've done. It's still turn-based for the majority, but there are some real-time elements to it where you're able to straight up take enemies out in the field that are weaker than you taking them out without much of a fight, but they can still attack and deal some minor damage to you but you can dodge to avoid this, or attack and stun enemies for 1 turn cycle before going into Squad battle (turn-based combat), but if you get hit by enemies around your level or higher you get ambushed and the enemy attacks first, I just let this happen sometimes because the ambush song is so dang good!

The story and world are both so interesting and engaging, the story has had me by the balls the entire time and I've never been so addicted to a game such as this. I can't praise this game enough! Black Myth: Wukong was originally my GOTY, but now this is. If you like Atlus games, go play this NOW! If you haven't played any games from Atlus before but like JRPG's with an in depth time management and deadline system where every character feels real and relatable in some way, not to mention a very interesting advanced style fantasy world, give this a try.","50 people found this helpful."
"BeLikeBisharp","3 months ago","I'm quite fond of JRPGs as a whole but mostly Persona Games ; and honestly, Metaphor: RF might be the best one I've ever played.
Saying it's perfect wouldn't be true. However, it improves on a LOT of recurent issues with the JRPG genre.

The story is honestly pretty good! Far from flawless but it still does its job. The bond are especially interesting (won't spoil anything but I highly enjoyed 12/14 bonds which is a huge amount). This might be the 3rd JRPG in which I got highly invested in the plot (the other two being P5R and DQXI).
However, I think the biggest strength of this game is BY FAR its gameplay. The ARPG aspect is fine, I really love how it was implemented and used in some Dungeons (won't spoil much but for example, there are some enemies hidden beind pillars waiting for an ambush and I think that's brilliant) but the risk/reward is a bit over the top (sometimes the difference between stunning an ennemy and getting hit can determine wether you get a flawless victory or straight up lose, which is made especially annoying by the ennemies sometimes having armor on their hits...). That being said, the turn per turn gameplay is VERY good and much better than any other Atlus Game. I never really liked the concept of All Out Attack in Persona, just getting big raw damage for hitting weakness felt blank and uninteresting. In Metaphor: RF though, hitting weakness simply allows you to get more actions during your turn, allowing for more elaborated strategies which I'm a huge fan of. This is one of the only JRPGs ever in which I never avoided battles unless necessary, it's just that addicting.

Now for what is in my opinion the most well made gameplay aspect:  The Archetype System. It improves so much on so many aspects it's hard to choose were to start honestly.
- First of, there are 14 archetypes in the game. This in my opinion is the key to understand why they work so well. With fewer options to work on, the Game Designer really had the time to make each Archetype very unique, distinct and interesting from the others. They are also all super cool looking which is a HUGE constrast to Persona Games which force you to play ugly Personas for most of the game.
- As mentionned right above, (almost) every Archetype is unique (Dragoon is a mistake and we don't talk about it, mostly for spoiler reasons), which allows for a LOT of interesting team compositions, especially considering the fact that every character can learn (almost) any Archetype.
- They make bond rewards especially worth it. In Persona Games, only the Main Characters will get their evolved Personas at Max Bond. In Metaphor Re:Fantazio however, EVERY bond is tied to an Archetype and thus increasing said bond allows you to both unlock then evolve said Archetypes (i.e. unlocking their stronger forms) and get rewards that might help your progression (won't push on this to avoid spoilers but most bonds are VERY worth your time).

To conclude, the fact that this game is THIS good even though it was unfortunatly rushed and is thus unfinished (there are 2 playable characters and 7 unused bonds in the game files) is mindblowing to me. I really hope this game will get DLC to adress this issue. That being said, this is EASILY my GOTY. Thanks for reading.","14 people found this helpful."
"نو نيم","5 months ago","In  a generation full of remakes, remasters and sequels of a 20+ year old franchise Metaphor stands out as new IP and what happens when you give top tier developers the creative freedom and budget that they deserve.

I still have not finished the game but im very far and i can safely say this might be the best Jrpg i have ever played and i say this as someone who grew up with the genre, Katsura hoshino and his team are some of the best Jrpg developers out there and they have made SMT nocturne, Persona 3-5 and catherine and you can see from this game is the culmination of all their work.

+While this game does indeed use the persona formula this game perfects it 100% some people might be turned off by this because people want to see a new formula but honestly? i prefer it if they use something they are experienced with rather than have them create something new and result in an uneven formula, it also establishes its own identity that separates it from persona. 

+Social sim when it comes to spending time with main/side characters in the persona games the quality felt uneven and inconsistent with mediocre rewards, this game takes it to the next level not only are they way better when it comes to writing, they are great because they unlock important rewards. 

+Combat is incredibly balanced with some of the best usage of the job system i have ever seen, many of the boss fights feel like puzzles and the difficulty is fair and there is so much potential and possibilities when it comes to party and class mash ups, the action combat also makes the combat much better allowing you to take care of trash enemies and have a high risk/reward enemy encounters.

+Side quests/hunts are excellent, sometimes they send you to dungeons that are usually fun to explore and give you a chance to level up your classes without feeling getting bored from grinding and these quests usually have great rewards. 

+Art direction is phenomenal, from enemies, environments, UI and animation are top tier.

+A sense of adventure that was very missing in the persona games, in the persona games u are still stuck in the same city, while in this game you travel around the world and learn about its world and the worldbuilding in this game is deep and will reward you for exploring it. 

+ Incredible Story with the best characters atlus has written, its very hard to talk about the story without spoiling it but the story focuses on 3 main things, what it takes to face your fears and make a meaningful change in the world/Racism and how its tackled especially with the characters coming from different tribes/Can fantasy have an impact on the real world and the game delivers on these themes beautifully.

+Pacing in this game is the best atlus has ever made, while the story does indeed ramp up as it goes it remains consistent without it feeling bloated, this is an area that 90% of jrpgs struggle with including the persona games and its really crazy for this game to have such an amazing pacing for an 80 hour+ game.

-Probably the biggest gripe i have with the game is the fact that so much of the dialogues are not voiced, which is a shame because the voice acting is amazing. 

-Engine is a tad bit outdated with many loading screens especially when exploring towns.

Overall Metaphor takes atlus to new heights and not only lives up to the insane expectations set by Persona 5 but even surpasses it, making it one of the best games i ever played.","70 people found this helpful."
"Gilles Sooben","5 months ago","Is this a special or outstanding game like critics and the fandom rave about? Absolutely not. Not in any shape or form. 
Baldur's Gate 3 and Persona 5 were special, but this isn't. I spent 98 hours to see the end of this exhausting game. It's one of those stories that tries too hard to be smart and ends up being a convoluted mess and drags on forever. 
There are about 20 games between the Persona and SMT series alone, there's nothing that can justify Metaphor RF as original or groundbreaking. Sure, it improves on the formula, at least in certain aspects, but most of the flaws that you will find in other Atlus games are still present. More importantly, there is little to no innovation here. The Main character is as generic as they come, with the worst haircut I've ever seen in a jrpg. The main villain is a cheap knockoff of Berserk's Griffith, the secondary villains aren't any better, most companions have the exact same personality as their counterparts from other Atlus games, the graphics are dated, the story is full of tired clichés and dramatic contrivance, twist and turns that aim to surprise the audience but make no sense whatsoever. It's so bad it's funny at times. 
The difficulty spikes are completely out of balance, you get hardlocked into battles that are incredibly long and tedious, getting your ass whooped even with the highest level of equipment and archetypes. You can't even return to the Main Menu or Load a save once you enter combat. You are too often given options only to have that annoying Gallica say you can't do this, you can't say that, and are forced into one choice. Why bother having options to choose from then? Experimenting with various archetypes outside of dungeons can have catastrophic consequences as story related quests will often throw you into major boss fights without giving you a chance to adjust your party's archetypes, something that is cruelly lacking from the Party Menu. What got on my nerves as well is that YOU play the main character but it's always someone else who is centre stage and gets to do the big speeches. The hero is a voiced character, but he hardly ever says his lines out loud. All you do is nod most of the time and make the odd decision that has no consequences whatsoever because everything is scripted anyway. And there's soooo many lines of dialogue, nobody shuts up in this game. It's always yap yap yap. And if the writing was good it wouldn't be so bad but most of it is just repetitive platitudes and exposition dumps. The dungeons are tedious, with very little originality in the level design. The game insists you grind for hours, which is boring and exhausting. 
Not to mention the blatant plot holes that make most parts of the story completely pointless. 
Is it Game of the Year material? Hell no. But the mainstream game critics need something else to justify their snobbery of Black Myth Wukong and decided to worship this one instead. None of the main video game reviewers have addressed the issues of this game. Which can make them only 2 things: incompetent or dishonest.","62 people found this helpful."
"Blaze 81G","2 months ago","Metaphor: ReFantazio delivers a truly immersive experience, blending an engaging story with a rich fantasy setting that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The world-building is phenomenal, filled with breathtaking landscapes, diverse cultures, and a sense of wonder that draws you into its every corner. The narrative strikes a perfect balance between epic and personal, weaving grand stakes with heartfelt character moments. Each character feels distinct and memorable, with motivations and arcs that add depth to the story and make their journey genuinely compelling.

One of the standout aspects of the game is its open-world and dungeon exploration. The environments are beautifully designed, offering plenty of opportunities for discovery and adventure. The exploration is both fun and rewarding, with hidden treasures, secret passages, and optional challenges that make every detour worthwhile. The dungeons are cleverly crafted, combining challenging puzzles with exciting combat encounters that keep you on your toes.

Overall, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a must-play for fantasy and RPG fans. Its captivating story, unforgettable characters, and dynamic exploration mechanics create an experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Whether you're unraveling the main plot or simply wandering through its vast, magical world, the game is an adventure worth savoring.","2 people found this helpful."
"Martin Story-Kapusta","2 months ago","Just finished it, clocking at around 120ish hours on Hard mode.

Unbelievable game, true to Atlus-Persona style, but with a great medieval fantasy mix! Haven’t had such a journey in a video game in a long while! This really is an exemplary game, a testament to how classic JRPGs can be amazingly beautiful, fun, and moving. 

Above all, the message it sends about the power and creativity of fantasy/dreams (and to confront our own anxieties rather than running from them) in order to create change in a world that is rife with difficulty - is refreshing to see during a time when so many games are pumped out for the sake of it.

Bravo!!

"Armando Alvarado","5 months ago","Waited so long for a Persona 5 successor. P5: Royal was an amazing addition to an already master piece, but it was still more of the same experience. Metaphor: Fantazio re-imagines and evolves the SMT and Persona formula. With an amazing story that is inspired by past fantasy stories like Berserk, Final Fatasy, Tales Series and Lord of the rings, the world of Fantasio is so rich and captivating. The combat is refreshingly fun. all the characters are well written and just as lovable as past Atlus Games.

"K Starks","3 months ago","Super niche game.

Like the persona games there’s some philosophical theories being examined in this game. If persona 5 was a critique on one’s role in society, Metaphor is a critique on who we choose as leaders of that society. Persona 5 has it easy. You are the fun rebel. Society is broken, but you never have to try answer how it should be fixed. Metaphor delves into what makes a good ruler, but it never really answers that question well. It gives bad examples that any young adult should be able to recognize. Its characters are only tools help answer that question. This is probably what hurts the story the most. It makes them feel less human and more like “Archetypes” in a story. I don’t think that’s a horrible thing, but it’s worth dropping the score half a star. 

I guess my only other complaint is the dungeon design gets pretty weak as the game progresses. People may complain that it’s repetitive, but I think MP management is more of where the game challenges you. Especially on the more difficult game settings.

Music is awesome. They went for a theme and it’s consistent all the way through. If you love the intro music, you’ll probably like the whole soundtrack. Voice acting is tight. I’ve only heard the JP VAs though.","2 people found this helpful."

I'm not typically a fan of JRPG or turn based combat, but I'm having so much fun with this game. It's like playing through an amine as it's main character. There is a lot of story and you control the responses your character gives. When I'm not in gameplay I just set it to auto advance and sit back and enjoy the story. I'm playing on normal difficulty and it seems easy at first but as you progress you actually have to put some thought into your tactics. Keep in mind you will be seeing the controller down a lot and just listening, this definitely isn't a game for everybody.","1 person found this helpful."

"Jlm","a day ago","Not worth the price. There's too much pointless dialog. You will be riding on a ship and a cutscene happens where the pilot says ""Hey, there's a cool tree! Let's stop here"" and then the narrator says ""The party found a cool tree and decided to stop here."" There are times when the characters have a discussion about their plan and say ""Let's go do the mission!"" and it cuts out and back into more talking about the plan that they just talked about
  The difficulty is foolish. I started on hard, got my butt kicked by a boss in a cave so I went to normal and then the boss was simple. I went back to hard for the monster baby dungeon in the 2nd city but it still felt easy after leveling up. Speaking of the monster baby, there is a stealth segment in the middle of the dungeon were you have to fight the baby if it catches you and it is nearly impossible to kill. The stealth segment is super simple and i only got caught to try and fight the baby, but it was too much, so I figured that this fight would happen later in the game when i was stronger... NOPE! The baby was the boss at the end of the same dungeon and it was much easier this time with no explanation for why. That is PATHETIC game design!
  I bought this for ps5 on sale and still overpayed. I can't imagine spending $70 on this! Graphics are cheaper than ps3 games. Music is average.

It showed that even some vile people have a heart and desire a better world, or have good reason to despise it. This does everything it set out to do and more.

NG+ Spoilers:

To not be able to have the Prince Archetype unlocked from the start? That's just a really bad decision. Locking everything until your unlock them again is also a crap move. 

I want to run my party with Critical Resist and COMPLETE ailment resist abilities, but those are tied to endgame Archetypes.

Not transferring Stat boosts is also a major no no. In Persona games this would carry over, not here though. It's like they forgot what made NG+ fun in those.

I can start Regicide difficulty only on NG+, so it's already pretty much trivialized.

Also they kept the BS mechanic of getting One-Shotted by the 2 hardest bosses in the game if you have any repel armor. It's not as bad as grinding like an idiot to max stats for the active party to fight Elizabeth, only to find you can only fight her as the MC.

"HJ Yang","2 months ago","It was fun until the final fight with Louis. I had Prince, Royal Knight, Saviour and General, also tried a few different party. Only had enough MAG and hero resources to get one royal team mate.

The final battles only served to make me regret all the MAG I've spent and exchanged for money to buy gear, regret all the baths I've taken and the books I've read instead of building relationships with my team mates. Why did I bother to explore the world when it won't serve me in the final battles? I don't want to replay the game just to prep myself for the final battles.

Why did Louis need 6+4 turn icons when he could wipe out half the team in 2 turns and slowly kill the remaining two members in 4 turns or less? I switched to storytelling mode and observed how Louis spammed MP and my side keep reviving. Both sides cheated equally. It takes the fun out of strategy games even if it's turn-based strategy. BTW, Louis would evade your attacks when he's down to last drop of HP, even AFTER you've debuffed his stats. Such a nice trick to make players panic, losing all turn icons and hand over your remaining HP to his 6+4 turn icons.

There's a trend ever since Dark Souls games to make battles unrealistically difficult, just to make people drill, like slaves to the game. I'm not playing just to train muscle memory for a specific game. This takes the fun out of playing when you can't get out of drilling.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The overwhelming positive reviews have lead me to believe that this is a great game to dive in first as an introduction to Altus games. Sadly, I think these reviews are from niche gamers who love this genre, and it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. I can't help but notice that I spend more time reading dialogues than actually playing. This game does feel like a movie, but a long, slow cooking one. It is enjoyable for the part that I actually get to play, and the characters are interesting, but that's it. I almost feel like I'm in the sea, and just getting dragged by the waves in this game.

You get used to it after a bit though and the 2D animated cutscenes shine more when they do pop up.

Some of the characters are cool, but I feel they don't get as developed as characters in the persona series. I actually don't like turn based games, but persona series got me hooked with the story, humor, and combat/persona catching. Overall, metaphor refantazio is a good game, and I got it for 20 bucks so no regrets. But it's definitely not going to satisfy anyone looking for kind of like the future persona 6.","4 people found this helpful."
"Stephen John Cook","4 months ago","Surprisingly loving this ATM. At first thought this is a sad departure from the usual antics of persona but this is quite the evolution. Different topics different battle strategies. Twist and turns in the story keeps it from being too repetitive. 30hrs in and curious what else is still to come!","1 person found this helpful."
"Marine Paingarden","4 months ago","It's good, indeed. But i think it's a bit too overhyped. 
Some scenes are a bit too rushed like a certain first character's death, and then some key point is sometimes missed.
Also I was expecting music but it's also 8-9/10 and nothing outstanding.

Still, I appreciate this game so very much because with recent trend, 
we rarely have adventure themed turn based game.","2 people found this helpful."

We got Granblue Fantasy: Relink in January, Persona 3 Reload and FF7 Rebirth in February, Unicorn Overlord in March, Eiyuden Chronicles in April, and several other solid offerings. Metaphor ReFantazio stands above the rest though and I say that as a massive Final Fantasy VII fan.","5 people found this helpful."

Engaging story & a nice blend of action and turn based combat, good pacing. 10/10.","1 person found this helpful."
"Uyen Le","5 months ago","Amazing game. The story is so beautiful and well-written. It's a dark fantasy where you ain't a high schooler saving the world. I love this new dark medieval take. I hope there is a sequel in the future!","6 people found this helpful."
"Elliot T","2 months ago","The gameplay was repetitive. Fighting mechanics feel standard turn based jrpg. The leveling system is very well done; I have to admit. 

As for the story ... Meh. These characters sometimes talk nonstop and often without saying anything new. I never once felt surprised or stimulated by the story's turns. I picked the game up mainly because I had heard the story was amazing and it absolutely is not.","1 person found this helpful."
"Gabriel Lung","a day ago","Greatest JRPG of all time. Fantastic story, premise and plot that is very well written. The lore is amazing. Magical soundtracks, perfect cast and the artstyle blows my mind. The combat and gameplay is just peak.

"Rae P Williams","3 months ago","Spoilers.....




Are you kidding me?? You put a dragon in the first few hours of the game and I beat it, only ro get a nice sword. So I equip that sword to a companion only for you to kill them off still in first couple hours of the game and you don't put the sword into my inventory..... wtf I mean it's decent story but come on how was I supposed to know to unequip it from him before you took him away.... this is really annoying. Good game but this really ticks me off.","Was this review helpful to you?"

"Isa","5 months ago","Yeah it’s good just solider through the first 2 hours. It’s a copy paste RPG that I’m playing through just for the loot and story. If you’ve played persona it’s more of that but with a good story and a handful of new mechanics + quality of life optimizations. 

It’s a good game, just don’t expect a gaming revolution with this one. Also idk if the graphics are any different on PS5-4","1 person found this helpful."
"Michael Rowe","4 months ago","I thought FF7 rebirth is GOTY, Metaphor: Refantazio is making me think hard about that decision.

This game brings nothing new to the table and recycles the usual JRPG tropes and Atlus formula.
