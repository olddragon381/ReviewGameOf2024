"Trav","2 months ago","I was originally not going to get the game, in fact I had not even heard of it until shortly before it released, but around 3 months after launch I decided to give it a try because it looked stunning visually and interesting story wise. I am happy to say, it exceeded my expectations as everything from the combat, to the story, to the visuals, to the different art styles in the cutscenes, to the replayability has me hooked to this day. The combat is fluid, and satisfying, while also allowing many customization options in your builds. Although your light attack combo stays the same throughout the game, you will unlock different staff stances to mix up your heavy attacks, and varied combos which you use by pressing heavy attack in the middle of light attacks. the varied combos give you invincibility, which if you time right will see through the enemy attack, creating as satisfying counter. You can also follow up on these varied combos smoothly with a brand new varied combo extender by pressing light or heavy attack again, allowing you to seamlessly do a variety of attacks that each have a situation they are best in. The story is great, being a continuation of the classic Chinese tale Journey to the West. The graphics are incredible, even exceeding games that have a much higher cost to create. Optimization is great on PC, which is surprising considering the size and graphics of the game, but not sure how it does on PS5 because I haven't played it on there. I highly recommend Black Myth: Wukong to any fans of Action RPG's or anyone who is interested in the game.","You and 19 other people found this helpful.","19 people found this helpful."
"James Lough","4 months ago","Black Myth Wukong is a completely unforgettable Action RPG experience that had me hooked from the breathtaking opening cutscene all the way to the epic final boss fight.

The storytelling, soundtrack, and art direction are all utterly enchanting. The game is split into six chapters and each chapter ends with a spectacular handcrafted cinematic that gives vital context to the main story events which took place in that chapter. Each of these end chapter cinematics is a pleasure to experience due to the phenomenal animation work and musical score. Some of the cinematics can also be surprisingly emotional due to the at times downright heartbreaking stories told within them. The game features a colourful cast of strange, captivating, and fascinating characters that populate each chapter. Moreover, the Ancient China inspired environments that the player must explore in each chapter are visually arresting and have incredible attention to detail.

The combat is smooth, well designed, and thrilling. It starts off relatively simple and straightforward with only a select few attacks and spells at the player's disposal. However it quickly gets a lot more diverse with a variety of different attack stances, powerful defensive counterattacks that are unique to each stance, and an arsenal of varied spells (including transformation spells that allow you to transform into defeated bosses and gain their abilities) that are each meant to be used to exploit the weaknesses of specific bosses. 

The combat system also takes inspiration from Santa Monica's recent God of War titles by giving individual upgrade trees to each attack stance and spell that the player can specialize in. However, Black Myth thoughtfully improves upon this system by allowing the player to reset any of their skill trees for free. This means that if a player is having a hard time against a particular boss with their current stance build then they can simply switch their skill tree points to a different stance to see if it works better.

The jaw dropping boss fights are definitely the main focal point of this game and they compliment the combat system extremely well for the most part. The bosses usually have a gradual difficulty curve in each chapter. They start off relatively predictable but towards the end of the chapter they become lengthy and riveting battles against the odds that force you to make use of everything you have learnt up until that point. 

The game also makes crucial innovations on boss design through designing many bosses to be able to learn from the player's behaviour and adapt their fighting styles accordingly. This effortlessly punishes players who overly rely on one spell or attack stance and stops them from using their abilities carelessly. 

The chapters in the latter half of the game each have one optional superboss that is much harder than any of the mandatory bosses in that chapter. These bosses provide an extra challenge for those who truly want to push the limits of their skill and are usually among the most visually striking and memorable boss encounters in the game.

Overall, this game is absolutely enthralling from start to finish. I would recommend this to any seasoned Action RPG fan and especially to those who are also fans of Journey to the West (since this game serves as an excellent continuation of the historic novel's legendary story).","You and 28 other people found this helpful.","28 people found this helpful."
"Jasmine Sales","3 months ago","By far the best game i‚Äôve ever played, simply phenomenal on every accord. The voice acting is phenomenal every cutscene and fight has me on the edge of my seat the whole way through and not to mention the overwhelming beauty present in said fight. It feels like every pixel of this game was hand polished to absolute perfection. It‚Äôs more difficult than your average game but still easy enough for a decent player to beat most bosses first or second try, just the perfect balance of souls like and action game flare. Those bosses are a pleasure to fight with the incredibly varied combat mechanics making every battle truly riveting. The art direction of this game too is on another level of quality, every enemy and character gets inked portraits accompanied by several poems about them. Even the most basic of enemies get beautiful stories about who they are and their cultured paired with these breathtaking portraits. The game has several beautiful murals of your players escapades that are fitting of a museum, and after you get the pleasure viewing them you are treated with the games ‚Äúmusic videos‚Äù. the music videos tell the story of either wukong himself or a tale of the chapter area, these are done in various forms of animation, from anime like, to scrolls, to even stop motion the game staggers you with overwhelming care. It not receiving game of the year is nothing short of a tragedy, as it is the first and likely only game i will ever truly call a 10/10, thank you black myth wukong.","You and 14 other people found this helpful.","14 people found this helpful."

Truly a 10/10 masterpiece to play and barely any bugs seen on PS5. A game of the year and A game worthy to talk for a generation as how being a AA company Game Science really did'nt bend and broke every greedy game reviewer politics out there who are always using gender inclusivity and diversity to extort money (like seriously they made a monkey king game which is faithful and characters perfectly designed per the cultural mythic tale 'Journey to the west' where its all monsters, furries wth did they expect black human characters and female monkey queen?üòí). This is a people's choice and a proof of how well a game can be made if its well cooked with patience. A total must play and way too much worth for the price. This game is the example how to capture all the original gaming audience as well as new gen audience. Kudos Game Science and we are definitely looking forward for more Black Myth series üëè‚ù§

"Henry Tran","6 months ago","As I was born and rise in Vietnam, in a heavily Chinese culture town. This game gave me so much memory and so many goosebumps.

Wukong is an amazing action RPG that brings the rich tapestry of Chinese mythology to life in a way that is both visually stunning and profoundly engaging. From the moment you step into the shoes of the legendary Monkey King, Sun Wukong, you are transported to a world brimming with vibrant landscapes and formidable foes.

The game excels in its graphical presentation, with meticulously detailed environments that range from serene ancient forests to imposing, mystical realms. The art direction combines traditional Chinese aesthetics with modern design principles, creating a visually captivating experience that stands out in the genre.

Combat in Black Myth: Wukong is a standout feature, offering a blend of fluid, dynamic action and deep strategic elements. The Monkey King's shapeshifting abilities add a layer of complexity to battles, allowing players to adapt their tactics on the fly. Each encounter feels fresh and exhilarating, thanks to the diverse range of enemies and intricate boss fights.","You and 16 other people found this helpful.","16 people found this helpful."

"A Gutierrez","5 months ago","Well what a game, everything that we expected from the trailers and more.  This game reminds me of the old days where you paid for a game and didn't have to worry about any DLC or if you had to pay to get extra stuff. It's back to the essence of actual game play that's for the gamer, and for that, I'm so thankful.  Not many games like this exist anymore, and it's a shame because it's what the gaming industry is missing.
Now, to what you came for, is this a game worth getting? Answer is YES. 
You will find that it's an engaging game that keeps you on your toes, and even though you will die a lot, and I mean a lot at first, you will not want to give up. That's a sign of a good game if ever I played one.
The story is really cool because I don't know much of Chinese mythology, but it's become something which I ended up looking up, so that's another plus for me.
There is a huge amount of boss fights, which is very unique but I aint complaining.
Graphics are top notch and also 3 different styles of staff stances which you can interchange.
Story is well done as I write this because I haven't finished the game but I'm a happy customer.
Uk price was ¬£55 which is cheap compared to other games and what they offer (or don't offer) and I've had so much to do so price wise is very much worth your money.
Nothing but good things from this game and I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I have.","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

Like when I first started playing this game I was kind of disappointed.. because I didn't know how much stuff you can do with that staff and all different types there are.i amcurrebtly at hour 28 and im on chapter 5. This game is a true gem indeed. I even think about this game when I'm delivering packages for Amazon hahaha I just want to come back and progress through to the next area/secret/boss/chest..etc. 

Score? 10

It is just amazing how fluid the combat is and how many different builds you can make and you can respec your skill points at any time at any 'rest' point! So you can always tinker and find what play style suits you for the whole game or the current situation

"Cole Chatfield","6 months ago","When I originally saw this game to be honest, I thought it was going to be a complete flop, I absolutely will say I stand corrected in this game was extremely refreshing to play something and see the potential of going with a genre and making a game really enjoyable. if you like the souls like genre, it‚Äôs definitely for you. 

The combat was extremely fluid, the movement the feeling and the abilities they cost you with were new, I would almost compare it to a mix of God of war and Elden ring. The storytelling also by far was extremely well done and intriguing. You felt pretty invested overall at least I did. I‚Äôm generally a person who skips through even with the souls games/elden ring and the story line because I am a player who more so plays games for the gameplay and challenege. To watch the majority of cut scenes in this game. 

I also think something that makes this game. Different from the other souls like franchises, is that they made this game I would almost say less punishing. I enjoyed that They separated the xp system from the skill trees. I also enjoyed the fact that you can pause this fights in comparison to a lot of other souls based games. The bosses are extremely fun, although easier, they do add some of the bosses in, that are very challenging and more what a Elden ring style player is looking for. They make you feel like you‚Äôre at the same level as the bosses when fighting them, if not a little above them, which sometimes can be frustrating, but there‚Äôs also bosses in between that are pretty difficult if you‚Äôre new to the souls like genre

Really my biggest gripe I would say, and this is the only thing that I found to be a little poor execution, Is at times the game can be spaced out from enemy to enemy. It makes you feel like you kind of have to walk some distance and then you fight a couple super easy enemies and then you‚Äôre 2-3 more minutes before you find something else, however, I think with how many boss fights they have in the game, and the way the maps are laid out and all of the secrets in additional side quest that go pretty deep. I think this is something that is not that big of a deal in the bigger scheme of things. And this game is definitely worth playing.","You and 10 other people found this helpful.","10 people found this helpful."
"Mania Carta","7 months ago","Black Myth wukong is very cool game, despite all issues in game and cinematics, environment are not open world and they are invisible wall in each chapter which is quite boring to not explore, they are so much overlap of clothes and even wukong staff,  there is no collision in any megascan asset,  so everything is overlapped, they are also so much bug in cinematics and boss animation, for example the wind sage in his phase 3 when he launch his trident and then he run to pick it up, the trident animate in it's own and not stay stick to the ground.
But anyway the game and visual look amazing especially the forest made with megascan and the winter map where you battle the dragon.
Still the game can be more polished for future new patch especially the overlaping of clothes, you can never see final fantasy games character there hair and clothes overlap with other objects, such point can make the game look bad, so seeing wukong staff go inside a rock and walls doesn't make any sense and such issue is in the whole game, the motion capture of every character and bosses was studied very well as also camera cinematic in game, despite all that the game is challenging and look promising and really such team of talent artist put there soul and heart to bring something new to the public.

Well done Game Science despite the challenge to learn unreal engine and the whole secret behind making AAA games i am sure you are going to bring more beautiful works in the future snd learn from such mistakes.","You and 56 other people found this helpful.","56 people found this helpful."
"Ismael Acosta","6 months ago","Playing on PS5, so far technically no big issues. Some frame drops here and there and one crash. Other than that game is running great and looks amazing.

Combat is so satisfying and enemy designs are incredible. The boss fights really highlight how good the combat is once you understand the mechanics.

Story wise, since I'm not very well versed on Journey to the West aside from knowing Wukong and knowing just some basics it has been a joy to unfold. The ending chapter animated cutscenes are a joy to look at and delve into that chapters story without giving a big exposition dump. It is mostly told via visual story telling. There is a journal in game that holds more lore about each characters and the locations you visit.

Game can be a challenge, however most boss fights can be overcome by switching your build around. The game allows you to freely change your skills at the shrine, which is super helpful if you don't find yourself enjoying a spell or a certain skill. It

Overall highly recommend to anyone wanting to play a fun single player game with interesting story, great combat, amazing vistas, and just looking to monkey around.

Crazy to think that this is the developers first official game released. Will be keeping an eye out for Games Sciences next projects as if they put this much love and attention to their first ever title, I can't wait to see what is to come next from them seeing what they have learned from this experience.","You and 13 other people found this helpful.","13 people found this helpful."

Unlike games that have been plagued with micro transactions, underwhelming graphics, and stale and unfulfilling stories, Black Myth Wukong was able to create a masterpiece just as Elden Ring held up to its own hype.

"Sage Balakrishnan","7 months ago","Insanely satisfying combat. Gorgeous world. And so many boss fights. The game that Sekiro fans have been waiting for (swap parry for dodge). Though the first couple hours didn‚Äôt feel as smooth as I‚Äôd expected and had me feeling a little disappointed, one early game boss fight not only brought my excitement up to where they were pre-launch but even higher. Despite what some people are saying, this is a Soulslike, albeit with a twist. High difficulty level, shrine-like save system, and many, many memorable boss battles. The dodge only combat works extremely well and creates satisfying, smooth and exhilarating fights. This is the most fast paced combat in any Soulslike, ever. This game caters strongly to the Sekiro fans, taking the rhythm based combat it used for parrying and exchanging it for dodging. It even has some bosses who are eerily similar to Sekiro‚Äôs. In my 15 hours of gameplay so far, the story is the weakest point of the game if you have no prior knowledge of journey to the west or who Wukong is (I knew nothing) but it still creates an entertaining experience. This may change mid-to-late game. 

Overall, Black Myth provides a beautiful, fast-paced, exciting action RPG that any fan of the genre should try out. My personal game of the year so far. 10/10","You and 85 other people found this helpful.","85 people found this helpful."

"Flamedust","7 months ago","Cons:
The combat system is just okay, far from matching the likes of God of War and Devil May Cry, or even Elden Ring. After all, this is the first time a Chinese game company has attempted a game at AAA standards, so achieving this level already exceeds expectations.
Another issue is occasional lag, but fortunately, since it's not an online game, I haven't been killed by the boss during those five-second freezes.

Pros:
Most notably, the graphics are praiseworthy. This is the first game that vividly portrays Chinese classical architecture, culture, and mythology. It's no exaggeration to say that solely based on the buildings featured in this game, it could potentially boost tourism across various Chinese provinces. These structures are akin to the Notre-Dame in Assassin's Creed. Not only has it influenced cultural tourism in China, even local traffic police social media accounts are riding its popularity wave. That's how crazy it is!
Regarding the storyline, for those unfamiliar with Journey to the West, the background may seem rather obscure. Luckily, having watched the classic 1983 TV series ""Journey to the West"" and read the original novel, I can navigate through its narrative context.","You and 18 other people found this helpful.","18 people found this helpful."

THE SECRET BOSSES  the way they hide it and amount of journey we need do is unbelievable and i know the there are lots of bosses but it is interesting to fight bosses with all DIFFERENT abilities

"Maiming Yinxing","7 months ago","I was really drown to the game after seeing some teasers/trailers cause the graphics looked absolutely stunning and being Chinese wukong was a household name for a fiction character. But I also kinda sensed there might be some mechanical issues with the game cause even though the game looked like a soulslike game but the pacing felt a bit off and all the trailers were about boss fight, no exploration no fighting minions or doing anything interesting outside of fighting boss.

Turned out I was right. LOTS of Boss fights is good when you have loads of other things to do like in Elden Ring. but this game is like the reverse. It's like they built the game with those fancy trailers in mind, it's like you are playing those boss fight trailer after trailer with nothing else to do in between. Bored and monotonous feel is what you get after a while. 

What I want to tell the devs is don't for a second think building a game as beautiful as Dark soul 3 or Elden Ring or Bloodborne is that easy. These games dont just have beautiful graphics but creativity, diversity, loads of contents, sophisticated combat system and lots of interesting backstory details. Wukong on the other hand is SKIN DEEP, other than it's drop dead gorgeous graphics, even the oeiginal god of war on PS2 can give you more fun than this over hyped and overpriced garbage.","You and 166 other people found this helpful.","166 people found this helpful."

Black myth Wukong is the most anticipated game for me and certainly one of the most beautiful video game in all time.I like the smooth combat system and its fluidity gameplay. Some hidden boss are quite fun and tough to beat. Learning curve for this game is quite decent and easy get use to the control and combo. Storyline for me is good enough and I like each boss represent very Chinese art style among goblin type. Some part I like the hidden Chinese concept represent story of monk and Wukong. There are female character like spider woman and boss fight like Kang Jin Star, I feel disgusted towards Gsme Rant reviewer who simply give assumptions by saying no female character, is like didn‚Äôt play game at all. Two cons are only the frame rate got slightly slow down in few scene and I wish it has guard system for this game but I understand it follow Journey to the West, other than that there more pros than cons.

And I can't wait. The game is beautiful. Not just technically speaking but absouletely in terms of art style as well. It's Unreal Engine 5 so I was a bit nervous for the PC version. I was realived when the game started by doing shader pre compilation. And I'm happy to report that it runs like silk on my specs (7800X3D, RTX 3080, 32 GB RAM, game installed on 1TB Samsung 980 Pro). Running it at 1440p, DLSS quality (70%), all settings except GI maxed out (no RT).

Into chapter 1, the lush jungle environment is beautiful, and I enjoyed the exploration, however I found the various plants and mushrooms to be a disappointing reward for peeking around corners and actually exploring. There are a LOT of boss fights, and most of them are not too hard. The gameplay is fun; is it the very finest? No, but its fun, and it has style. There are certain techniques I have yet to master, such as the heavy attack mid combo counter, and some of the staff stances. The combat is fun, but I do perhaps wish there was a little more precision required in attacking, opposed to just spamming the square button and safely rolling whenever I see fit, mid swing or not. Overall, I am very satisfied with the combat as a whole.
The story is, well, confusing, but maybe I have not been paying attention very well. There are many interesting and lively characters, excellent voice acting (in English, too) and the world is constantly catching my attention, whether it be stunning visuals, epic music, or a decapitated Rockstar with sick riffs and a killer voice.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."
"Vincenzo Ottaviano","7 months ago","Amazing game.
The graphic is superb, Nanite and Lumen together are a 10. The lights are so realistic it takes your breath away.
The game is very well designed and takes you through learning and using the different abilities step by step, so you end up using all of them during the whole game, unlike other games. The combat mechanics are fun and engaging.
The spells and abilities mechanics are very intuitive and fast to select, so you can focus on the fights all the time.
Despite some bosses are very difficult I never get tired of trying over and over again, unlike some soul games that have hard but boring boss fights.
With a bigger budget next time hopefully they will be able to make completely open world","You and 8 other people found this helpful.","8 people found this helpful."
"Bruce Wayne","3 days ago","Black Myth Wukong so far is just incredible game. Boss battle after boss battle after boss battle, I just couldn't stop playing. Graphically impressive, every animations are so fluid, gameplay is outstanding. The story is actually the core aspect of the game which is really interesting, but some people outside of China may have a hard time understanding the lore of the story. You may also encounter some significant FPS hits in certain areas/bosses, so you gonna need a really high end PC to run it smoothly. Other than that, it will be a Game of The Year contender. Definitely worth my time and money.
After the latest patch, game runs a lot smoother than before.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The story is rich and engaging, pulling gamers into a world that feels alive and compelling. Each boss fight and combat scene is brilliantly crafted, offering intense, adrenaline-pumping action that keeps players on their toes.

"Dylan Doherty","7 months ago","Wukong: Black Myth is in its purest form a masterpiece for the majority of people. For some it's a boss rush slash and hack game that isn't being given enough of a chance. 

It's not open world but open enough within its linear style sandbox maps that it remains entertaining. For me I love the boss rush and ranging difficulty. 

Nothing feels better than the satisfaction after grinding on a boss for an hour just to memorize their move sets and beat them. Every enemy is different and there is no sign of reskinned or repeated move sets moving from enemy to enemy boss to boss.

The combat is actually so fluid, fun, and visually striking. The graphics are incredible but aren't the reason I gave it 5 stars. I've almost 100 percent finished Chapter two and it seems the further into the story I get the more the world opens up and the more the Narrative of the story opens up. 

Exploration is hindered by invisible walls but honestly I'm not so stuck up to have it be a deal breaker with tons of secret areas and quests that force you to backtrack just to unlock a secret boss/ area continues to add to the marvel of what's been packed into these linear worlds.

Customization and unlocking new weapons and armor feels great.
All the 1 star reviews are people with much too high expectations or feel it doesn't adhere to the original story of Journey To The West. It's not a retelling but rather an adaptation. 

For Chinas first AAA game they have both room for improvement but also nailed every part they intended to nail perfectly. 

I'm sure the next game they make will adhere to the criticisms that people have on their first attempt. 5/5","You and 56 other people found this helpful.","56 people found this helpful."

I'm always apprehensive about buying games nowadays with the increased price tag. However this is 1000%  worth it. The game mechanics are simply breathtaking. The developers have designed a beautiful game. Using spells to immobilise an enemy, in any position they are in is incredibly designed. The movement amd combat remind me of a God of war crossed with a dark souls game. It is hard, but you get a true sense of accomplishment with every boss. 
I have recommended this to at least 6 of my friends who have all purchased and enjoying it.

3.map and bosses is actually very big with nice story telling albeit I know a bit about sunwukong story from the many tv series I watched as asians. A refreshing take when compared to GoW with its simple and liner story or vague lore bits threw all over the map ala Elden Ring.

"Al Ma (AM)","a month ago","For reference, I have platinum trophy on BloodBorne and level 430 in NG+10. I know what a difficult game is. This one is bitter sweet for me. I liked it a lot but there were things that pisses me off from time to time. The game was kind of well balanced for almost his entirety maybe except for the first tiger boss, but after going back to get some spells I was missing and some extra power, I've actually been able to pass through. Some bosses I made it through at first try while others after 5 to 20 tries which is still ok. My problems started with Erlang Sheen. I spent days on this boss and almost quit the game. The jump in difficulty was insane and nonsensical. There was no point in having a game difficulty ""5"" for 60 hours and all of a sudden jumping the difficulty from 5 to 20 in the last boss(talking about Erlang, not the wise sage ).Also the platinum trophy is beyond stupidity. You have to spend hours and hours hoping for a random drop that no matter how many ""dropping bust items"" you wear ,it will almost never happens. Also the input command is not accurate at all, one of the worst I've ever played with.A lot of time I find myself pressing button and there is a huge delay or nothing happened(only with this game). Beside these problems the story is good, graphics great and mechanics are cool. Just fix the nonsense.

UPDATE: After the update I only have complaints to talk about. They """"fixed"""" all the bosses making them way harder. Erlang like if wasn't difficult enough got a big buff and now he countered literally everything you do and the previous mechanichs no longer work. The boss fight is just you dodging nonstop for the whole fight with no way of breaking his shield or combos except for the fan which you can basically only use once. On top of that, they gave him a ton of new endless combo so basically in order to beat him you must became a god in dodging. I do not understand how people find this fight entertaing, you must literally play in 1way and ONLY 1 way in order to win otherwise you'll lose. There is no variety in the way you can play the fight because nothing else is going to work. If you find some fun in a fight where you can only dodge, well that's up to you. I do not. Unlike other people I do not have  the time or the will to become world champion in video games so for me this game is a big NO. If I wanted a FROMSOFTWARE game I would have bought that. This feel even worst because they changed the rules after the game was release and made it insanely difficult and if you skip this boss you won't be able to complete the game properly. My philosophy is pretty easy, if is more frustrating than entertaing is not worth my time. To be clear I was on NG+4 before got the platinum before the update so my complain is not for lack of skills. I went back to check if they fixed some stuff with the update and for me they made it worse.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

I was only able to play for a few hours at launch because i had to work the next day but was able to get through a few ‚Äúmain‚Äù bosses as well as the side bosses of those areas! (Which can sometimes be almost hidden so make sure to check everything before moving on!) 

The only real complaints is that every so often the frame rate would be off but didn‚Äôt take anything away from the gameplay as a whole! My second complaint is why can‚Äôt there be a block or parry!!! They already have the ability to parry arrows so it would be a cinch to incorporate it into that! But even without that the game is crazy good!

Let's be honest. If this was a From Soft game critics would have been gushing all over it. I'll confess being skeptical about the game until the last minute but I took a chance and don't regret it. Of course it's not perfect but none of the issues are game breaking and will surely be fixed with upcoming patches. I've been playing on Performance mode and the game still looks good and plays smoothly. More importantly, it's great fun. The game does a good job at introducing new mechanics and I found the learning curve very reasonable. The sound and music are awesome and it's just a shame that we have a silent protagonist as the Monkey King is known for his jests. Overall the game is well worth it and should be praised, especially at such an affordable price compared to greedy Ubisoft rehashing the same thing over and over at ridiculous prices.","You and 110 other people found this helpful.","110 people found this helpful."

It runs well, is challenging but playable, is very fun, is rich in lore, is full of art, it is one of the most culturally significant games I‚Äôve ever played, and it‚Äôs the best video to come out of China to date.

To put what this game is in perspective, it is one of those rare games that is as if a book of it‚Äôs own, but this book may as well be a sacred text as it‚Äôs such a rich and excellent continuation of journey to the west.

"Ryan Harp","6 months ago","100% completion review- the game is an absolute masterpiece. I‚Äôm now on NG+ and can‚Äôt wait to run through it again. 



**70hrs of playtime update**
The game now has 5 stars‚Ä¶artistically, cinematically and storyline are amazing. Its take a bit to get used to the fighting and play style and the first chapter or so seemed to be really boring until you start to get the hang of the game and get more involved into the story and characters.  Leveling up is great too as you can change your skillset as many times as needed or for a particular boss. I‚Äôve just finished chapter 3 and looking forward for more! This game is unique, at first I was upset that it wasn‚Äôt open world but it doesn‚Äôt need it. Some maps are so big it feels that way. They‚Äôve patched some bugs since release and feels a lot more fluid. There still isn‚Äôt a map but that‚Äôs part of the fun and mystery, discovering new places and bosses and chests along the way. You can always travel back to any level should you‚Äôve forgotten something along the way. I‚Äôm leaving my prior reviews up so you can see the rollercoaster of a ride it took me on through hour 1 and hour 70. I now love this game.  


** UPDATE** after first hour- this game is hot trash. 
It‚Äôs a linear npc and Boss rush with barely to no dialogue or storyline. You get stuck in corners and can‚Äôt see anything, I‚Äôm constantly panning the camera up to see what‚Äôs ahead, and it‚Äôs incredibly boring to not have an adventure in a game and only go from fight to fight. This game is an embarrassment and I‚Äôm ashamed to have fallen for the hype.  It plays nothing like God Of War or Ghost of Tsushima or has the story to keep your interest. You literally run in a straight line and fight a boss and then another boss and then another boss and then another boss and I promise I tried to give it a shot but it‚Äôs incredibly boring and plays choppy.  It needs so much to make it playable.

Likes: 
-map and character design
-Story
-Concept

Dislikes:
-No map
-Not open world 
-Fighting feels too light, like I‚Äôm hitting people with a Qtip
-Loading times
-Camera angle doesn‚Äôt allow you to get full feel of game, only what‚Äôs down and in front of you- I‚Äôm constantly panning up to see what‚Äôs ahead 
-I don‚Äôt think it garners the hype that preceded it, if anything, my review stars will likely go down rather than up. 

Will update review after more play through but if it‚Äôs boss fight after boss fight as I‚Äôm reading in other reviews this game will be incredibly boring for me-and that sucks.","You and 68 other people found this helpful.","68 people found this helpful."

"Rong Yi Lim","6 months ago","10 hours in and honestly, not really worth the hype. Game is jaw dropping gorgeous on a 4K OLED display, with RT and DLSS it runs smoothly most of the time but that‚Äôs about it. 

Story is lackluster and it is quite evident that the game is quite shallow and empty once you get past the visuals. 

You go from 1 place to another in a linear fashion: kill creeps, kill the boss, next area, rinse and repeat. 

The biggest letdown is the broken combat mechanics. This game artificially stretches the game time by making your upgrades having little to no impact. You can barely take any hits no matter how much defence, DR or health you have. You can barely cast any more spells no matter how much mana you have. Progression is so slow and meaningless it‚Äôs laughable.

Bosses have a ton of cheap, overpowered, AOE spells that they keep spamming without any cooldown so you barely even get close to do any meaningful damage. 

Standing far away to give yourself more reaction time? Forget about it. They can close the distance almost instantly, zip across half the arena and take a huge chunk of your life. Or scatter the whole arena with AOE damage leaving you helpless.

The only meaningful defence is the dodge that does jacksh*t because I‚Äôve faced enemies turning 180 mid air to slam unto you, or turn around to swing their weapon at you mid cast. It‚Äôs so broken and frustrating. 

All enemies can cause major knockbacks to you, cancel your animations, cancel your spells midcast with any hit. This broken mechanic + no cooldown spams is truly a double whammy.

Comparing to the likes of God of War where a well timed block opens up a window to counter attack, this is just 90% dodging and hopefully you luck out not getting hit by any of the bosses‚Äô broken moves. 

Thankfully I‚Äôm on PC and have the luxury of using trainers to even the odds. I‚Äôll shamelessly say this: I have a full time job and other commitments thus I have limited time per day to play. Retrying over and over again at ridiculously broken bosses isn‚Äôt something I would want to spend my precious time on.

"Emerson Caronan (Hairwithemz)","a day ago","This is purely based on my own experience. 

WARNING !!! If you are a casual gamer who wants to just enjoy a story then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!! As much as people say this is not a Souls like game the boss battles are unforgiving at times. I am mentally tired of trying to beat the Whiteclad noble. His first phase barely leaves me with any health and hardly any gourd going into the second phase. This game has become unplayable due to the fact that there is no way round this boss. You have to beat him. 

It's a good game thus far but without no difficulty settings or any forgiving mechanics in place the game punishes players for not getting timing correct which makes it like a souls game. Every other NPC you can button bash for the most part but for this boss it's too time consuming to try and defeat. What's worst is if you die in the second phase you have to go back and do phase 1 again. Leveling up your talent points does nothing for your defense and only allows you to unlock skill sets that imo aren't much help at this point in the game. I've tried to gain more levels but it doesn't make beating this chapter 1 boss any easier. 

I feel so stressed out and annoyed that I can't get beat this boss. I'm annoyed at myself that I cannot get the timings to dodge right. I'm annoyed at the game creators for not thinking about everybody who would like to play this game and focus on it's beautiful story without having to be punished by a boss that I find really challenging. I'm annoyed at all the gaming reviews that said this game was nothing like a souls game because the bosses are.

I don't regret many things in life but I really wish I never spent my hard earned money on this game. 

People reading this might laugh and think this guy's pathetic and what am I on about but there will be other people who want to know the story of journey to the west and would like to play this game. 

Just be warned that when you come across the Whiteclad Noble your in for a battle.

Positives are the graphics that's the only thing I can say.

UPDATE: I've finally beat the Whiteclad noble after 8 hours of trying. Thoughts still haven't changed the way I feel about this game

UPDATE: This is a journey but my admiration for this game is growing. I can finally appreciate the journey of self improvement. The ever elusive chasing of the win against each enemy is what drives me to keep playing. Pride is hurt every time I fall and there were moments when I felt the need to give up but my stubborness and pride refuse. As does the ¬£60 I paid for it. I'm glad I didn't though for the reasons mentioned above in this paragraph. I still would love to reconnect with the story properly though that's why I have bumped up back to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê instead of ‚≠ê. The game play alone would get ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê however to those that do not want a punishing/challenging time I would irk on the side of caution, hence why this whole review still stands","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

"Zachariah Hilty-Jones","6 months ago","Fairly confused by all the one star ratings for the game, it‚Äôs a great game with a fairly simple premise and story, mechanics are fluid and easy, no real dodging delay. I saw that most of the low ratings are by people thinking this is too hard or needs a difficulty slider. If I‚Äôm being honest though this game already feels like it‚Äôs too easy, I cleared almost all bosses on first try including the last Boss, (although Erlang took 5 tries) I also noticed complaints about having no map in the game, its fairly simple design and finding the secrets is pretty easy, no map is really necessary. I just really don‚Äôt get the low ratings, if you‚Äôre just bad at the game, that‚Äôs it you‚Äôre bad no point in review bombing a game that‚Äôs already extremely lenient to the player base.

Honestly this is just a popcorn casual game, fun for 20 hours of gameplay, closer to 30 for all the secrets. Ng+ only takes maybe 7-8 hours with all secrets if you have a good memory. It shouldn‚Äôt really get that repetitive until Ng+ either considering the different combos, spirits, and misc items.

"Hery Julianto","7 months ago","This game is nothing short of spectacular! It‚Äôs visually stunning, beautifully crafted, and offers a unique blend of thrilling fights, breathtaking views, and engaging combat.

Before deciding to buy and play 'Black Myth: WuKong', I did some thorough research to determine if it lives up to the hype. While I found many positive reviews, I also came across several criticisms and complaints that made me reconsider. 

My advise is 'Don‚Äôt let negativity sway you' and here‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt be deterred with these comments:

-Trailers look too good to be true: Sometimes trailers can seem misleading, but this game truly lives up to the hype.

-It doesn‚Äôt look like a Souls game: Some people argue that if it‚Äôs not a Souls game, it won‚Äôt be enjoyable. However, while Souls games aren‚Äôt for everyone, this one offers its own fun, challenge, and rewards.

-It looks like a Souls game: Others might complain about another Souls-like game. While it‚Äôs challenging, it‚Äôs more forgiving compared to other Souls games that can be punishingly difficult.

-It might be too short (20 hours of gameplay): While some may worry about the length, the game actually offers much more content than anticipated.

-It‚Äôs not an open-world game: Though it‚Äôs not an open-world game, it‚Äôs also not overly linear. There‚Äôs plenty of exploration and hidden areas to discover.

-It‚Äôs a boss rush game: While it features many bosses, it‚Äôs also packed with smaller enemies and challenges that keep the gameplay exciting.

It seems some critics are quick to judge without giving the game a fair chance. If you‚Äôre on the fence, I assure you it‚Äôs worth it, especially if you‚Äôve enjoyed the Sun Wukong character from TV series. Playing as him brings a wonderful sense of nostalgia and excitement.

In summary, this game is a fantastic experience and definitely worth your time!

"Nick Squires","3 months ago","It‚Äôs a good game, but it gets a bit repetitive. You fight your way through an area, then get to the boss, die to the boss, then grind through that same area  as many times as it takes to level up enough to beat the boss. Then rinse and repeat. 
To some degree, most Action-RPGs  are a variation on this theme, but Wukong takes it to another level. That being said, I really enjoyed the game‚Ä¶the graphics are great, the combat is fun and it varies enough to stay interesting throughout the game. I even enjoyed grinding to level up. I guess after playing over 4000 hours of Elden Ring I‚Äôve developed a bit of a taste for the grind. Lol
All in all, to me it‚Äôs an A-tier game. If Elden Ring hadn‚Äôt raised the bar though, it‚Äôd be S-tier. Although I‚Äôd almost put it in the B or C-tier just because of that damn bell or gong that rings really loudly before the game starts on PS5. What an incredibly stupid idea that was.

Overall i give it a 9.5/10. If there were not boarders for more open exploration i would give it a 10/10

"Lorenzo Escobar - Chilo Beats","7 months ago","This game is truly amazing. The audio, effects, artwork, battles, upgrades, and transformations are all top-notch. The ability to adjust your sparks to adapt your fighting style for different bosses adds a layer of strategy that's really satisfying. It's impressive that this is the company's first console game, and I hope they create more in the future.

For those criticizing the game for not being exactly Souls-like or for not being open-world: if that's what you're looking for, then this game might not be for you. Not every game has to follow those trends, and this one is fantastic in its way. If you're after a more story-driven experience, there are plenty of Telltale games out there for you. It's important to judge the game for what it is, not for what you want it to be. Just like there are different types of restaurants, clothing stores, and cars for different tastes, there are different types of games for different players. You wouldn't buy a Honda and complain that it doesn't feel like a Range Rover, so why do the same with games?

The visuals are great, the story is solid, and the fights are incredibly cool. If you have constructive feedback, like pointing out glitches or suggesting improvements that fit within the world of this game, that‚Äôs helpful. But asking for something completely different, like going to KFC and asking why their chicken doesn't taste like Jollibee's, just doesn‚Äôt make sense.

There‚Äôs too much toxicity and dishonest reviewing out there, often from people just looking for drama or attention.

The game is totally awesome, definitely a game of the year for 2024!
There is so many Boss fights, and ways to build your power and level up!
If you're into challenging games, this one is definitely up your alley!

"Dolmy Frazer","6 months ago","Good graphics, would've been better if they added:
*parry and countering, enemies are not that vulnerable to your attacks, they do serious damages, no matter the enemies type.
*Game is full of bosses 90+, wtf., that's a lot. You really have no time to level up your gear, after defeating one boss, you have another one just a couple of minutes later,  and they are not even well rewarded. The tools to upgrade your gears are very rare, blacksmith available until chapter 4.
* a compass on top of the screen would've been better 
* in setting, adding difficulty mode would've been also good because these bosses are really hard to defeat especially when their health bar is at 30%, their attacks are relentless and you have to dodge with a limited amount of stamina or mana. Very frustrating to fight a boss for hours and lose the joy to play or even forget the the storyline. Game are for fun, to relieve stress after work,  or a long day, not the other way around, wtf is wrong with you #gamescience.
If they could also add the always running like in God of war ragnarok, Wukon is strong but I feel like I'm always under leveled,  really not happy with the outcome of this game. Had to watch YouTube on how to beat different bosses, try glitches because some of these bosses are pure hell,  brace yourself, I think the health bar is to test your patience level and not enemies","You and 44 other people found this helpful.","44 people found this helpful."

While the game itself isn‚Äôt perfect and there were some graphic mishaps, the game really did great on storytelling. It encapsulates the characters in Wukong‚Äôs journey. 

I enjoyed the freedom of readjusting the skill points (Sparks) based on whichever my preference was. However, as I progressed, I encounter tons of errors which were overshadowed by the storytelling, interesting characters and tedious boss fights.

This game is not for those who just want to enjoy the story and combat, as the devs require you to be an experienced gamer of souls-like games. Honestly, it can get quite frustrating and annoying specially when you encounter frame drops and input lags on Playstation 5. 

Issues I have encountered:
- Frame drops
- input lags
- graphics issues on water and waterfalls 

The bosses, especially the final one with the Great Sage‚Äôs Broken Shell‚Äôs second phase was nonsensical, in my opinion. As ‚Äúthe destined one,‚Äù you have endured the journey of reclaiming all the relics and battling all the hard Yaoguia Kings, but all those hard fought battles are wasted in the final phase of the final boss, because he will just reclaim all the relics and beat your ass to death. I think the developers did not realize that they took all the narrative out away from the final mission by just beefing up the boss with unlimited powers.

Sure, the final phase of the final boss fight doesn‚Äôt have to be easy, but it does not have to be so terribly difficult and annoying, as the enemy has all the tricks at his disposal, while your character has limited mana, and nerfed attack abilities. Some, also, might say that it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúskill‚Äù issue, that‚Äôs true for some part, but not everyone is really good at executing perfect dodges, not everyone has keen eyes and great button mashing reflexes ‚Äî others just want to experience the game with its story and fun combat elements. This game has good storytelling but it is not really fun to play, especially for those who just want to enjoy the lore, mash buttons, and relax.

The game, also, does not have a map, so scouring the nooks of all the areas is important, as you might leave key items and some mini bosses undiscovered throughout the main storyline. Invisible walls are everywhere, too, so even if you want to enjoy the vastness of a location, you cannot really do that. 

To simplify, this game is basically: beat minions, fight buffed bosses, rinse and repeat. There‚Äôs nothing to do in between boss fights; it‚Äôs just more boss fights. I think lots of people were just overhyped about this game, especially those souls-like gamers.

Final thoughts:
Is the game fun to play? NO. It is challenging and satisfying, especially when you defeat a boss. If you want to play and have fun, I recommend playing or replaying Uncharted 4, because that game is one of the epitome of a real fun game.

Again, they said that this game is not a souls-like game, but it definitely has all the elements of a damn soul-like game with buffed bosses, and the constant dodges you have to execute just to keep your HP, your terribly limited stamina and mana bars. So, if you‚Äôre looking to play this for fun, I suggest you do not. The game is challenging at best and not fun at all.

Is this a GOTY material? It has some of the factors, but it‚Äôs not getting the GOTY, in my opinion. 

Is it worth buying? Yes, if you‚Äôre looking for a really challenging game, with OP bosses.","You and 54 other people found this helpful.","54 people found this helpful."

"Martin Dodd","6 months ago","What a game! It's got elements of Dark Souls, bloodborne, and Elden Ring rolled into one!
But yet it stands alone from any of the above!

It has great combat, that is fast, fluent, and easy to get the hang of.

The game has some really cool boss fights! Some which are fairly easy, but some that are quite challenging! Leveling up is a must! 

But rest assured, this isn't a super hard game to play unlike, say, Sekiro! Because that was an incredibly hard game to play!

It was a nice looking game, with similar graphics and combat to Wukong, but undeniably hard and unforgiving! 

Overall, I'd say Wukong is brilliant to play, great graphics, and great combat. If your a fan of Dark Souls, and like a game that doesn't hold your hand, then this is a game for you!

It's not the best story driven game, but where that lacks, the gameplay certainly makes up for it.

"Yong Wee Chew","6 months ago","Core combat system is great, and I like the flexibility of the flask system as well. 
Overall design is there, but the execution is very flawed:
- gameplay stutters (from chapter 3 onwards)
- tiny hit box on certain bosses which in itself isn't a problem but it's paired with large collision bounding boxes (events front) which prevent you from getting close so your attacks will often miss
- late game bosses felt very unfair rather than challenging (instant dodge, cancelling your charged attacks with any hit, tiny hit boxes, ridiculous HP, one-shotting etc.). This is in huge contrast to earlier bosses which were much better designed.
- pointless animations esp when respawning, and lengthy unskippable cutscenes in between boss phases (looks cool the first time, but if you keep dying and having to view it again and again it gets tiring real fast). Also the insanely long wind up of charge attacks is very punishing, given how difficult it already is to charge focus points on late game. Devs need to focus more on player exp rather than aesthetic flair.
- certain checkpoints are placed far away from bosses/optional bosses so you have to waste time running back to them every time you fail. This in combination with the previous point makes it seem like the devs do not respect the player's time at all. They ought to learn from the design of games like Ender's Lilies.
- lack of map, which is not too much of a problem until chapter 6 map where exploration becomes much more open.
- story telling is extremely barebones, and assumes players have knowledge of JTTW lore. TBF when I read the in depth lore analysis by other players things really do click together and the narrative is actually intriguing. This part is really a shame tho.

Honestly if I'd known about these issues I wouldn't have bought the game until they were ironed out. (I've finished it already but it was an extremely frustrating journey from chapter 3 onwards).
The game has potential but it really needs a lot of polishing, and I really mean A LOT, otherwise it's really more frustrating than fun at the later chapters.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

"Johnny","4 months ago","6/10. Overwhelmingly underwhelming. (spoiler free)
I think my expectations for this game were too high. Lots of people say it's a great game, one of the best they've played. But for me it's just pretty mediocre compared to games like Elden Ring or God of War. That being said there were still some good things about it. If you only want to read the good things then go to ""visuals."" 

Story: The story was pretty hard to follow. I think reading the actual Journey to the West book gives the necessary background for anyone to actually understand what's going on. At pretty much no point in the game did I understand anything, except the fact that the Destined One has to collect relics. For games like this story and characters are a big part of why I like them. 

Gameplay: The combat wasn't that good. Most of the time I felt like I was just spamming light attack then spam dodging whenever I felt like the enemy was going to attack. I would try to use the different attacks in my moveset but spamming light attack always worked best. I think there should be more incentive to use different types of attacks and abilities. Also this game has cooldown abilities, which appear a lot in other games like God of War and I'm not really a fan. I just use them all right when they recharge. Moving on to exploration, there's invisible walls everywhere, even at spots that look explorable. The map is linear enough so that it felt like I couldn't explore that much but it was open enough that I still felt like I needed a map (which wasn't there). 
I did appreciate that some of the bosses were difficult and required me to thoroughly learn the moveset to beat them. 

Performance: I don't really know much about performance but there's random drops in FPS and my game crashed at least twice, which is kind of crazy on a PS5. 

Visuals: This is my favorite aspect of the game. The scenery in each chapter was striking in its own way. The characters and bosses have unique and interesting designs. The graphics are nothing short of amazing.  

If you read all this I hope you have a better experience. I really wish I liked this game but I didn't. The endgame is pretty awesome, but it took me around 30 not so awesome hours to get there. It shouldn't take that long for a game to become fun. Not worth my $60. There's annoying haters for every good game, and I guess now I'm one of them.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

Reviewed on a PC: RTX 3070, Ryzen 5 5600, 32GB DDR4, SSD

This game was not marketed as a 'souls-like' game which caught my attention immediately. I personally don't enjoy souls-like games. However, the influence of the souls games is very clear. 

Is this game considered a generational great? I'd say it's on the verge of that. It is not a generation defining game but it has definitely influenced me and many other people in a good way. From the stunning graphics, AMAZING soundtrack/sound design and even extremely enjoyable gameplay, this game stands out as one of the greats of 2024. I can definitely see why this game has smashed basically every record that had been set previously on steam.

However, this game runs like absolute dogwater at times. Running this on an RTX 3070 at 1080p will give you a mostly 60-FPS experience. But with FSR enabled, the game runs reasonably well but with SEVERE ghosting and artifacting issues. Not only that, even after switching to DLSS, the game has severe pixelation issues. I ran this game on high/very high settings but the stuttering and random FPS drops made me annoyed at times especially when fighting a boss where milli seconds matter. 

I hope that the further patches and updates will make this game run slightly better. I might do a second playthrough after that.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Level design harkens back to games such as demon souls, where there are a few twists and turns, but ultimately there is one main path you need to follow. It's a good game, but it is definitely a souls-like. Anyone who claims otherwise is tripping.

If you like difficult bosses, where you will die multiple times, this game is for you. I saw another reviewer mention how this game is similar to Sekiro and I believe that's pretty accurate, however Sekiro felt a little more telegraphed in terms of deflections. You can definitely perfectly dodge every move, but it will take practice. That's particular what I love about these games: Deceptively simply, but with practice, it is mechanically complex.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Good
1: The combat can be fun when it decides to work or not have input lag
2: The visuals are amazing
3:Lots of bosses to fight
4: Equipment feels impactful as well as the spells when tackling a given situation.

Bad
1: The story is nearly non existent and the moving to each area is pretty much entirely unexplained with zero reference of your characters journey.
2: The main character is a mute plank of wood that if given a voice could better build the world he stands in
3: THE CAMERA IS TERRIBLE IN EVERYWAY. Oh large monster? lock onto its pinky toe. Get backed into a corner? ya you ain't seeing nothing but the death screen. Enemy moves really fast? Oh ya the camera ain't keeping up with that.
4: The game for whatever reason wants to use every single troll situation used in video games in the last 15 years countless times like its something special. (enemy knocks you off a cliff, Archer at the end of a narrow pathway, Enemies acting like they are dead)
5: While the game is beautiful, It uses way to many particle effects in some areas almost entirely obscuring the players vision. While cool it makes it impossible to react to boss attacks creating artificial difficulty.
6: The performance in some areas is really really bad.
7: While having a lot of bosses in the game is cool. It begins to suffer with some bosses just feeling really really bad to fight. Almost like they were not play tested bad. Attacks hitting when your nowhere near, camera getting jammed into the floor and some downright ignoring spells cast at them during normal attacks. Some attacks having no clear tell at all and the worst offender is the grab attacks that look like straight up normal attacks but will take 40%+ of your health and you will feel robbed when it happens.","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

Going from area 2 to area 1 non stop to get resources for a boss that‚Äôs in area 2 is boring as hell  

Visually this game is perfect. Mechanically it‚Äôs flawed.

You have a special attack where you change into another character with flamed blades , that character is pointless!!! It has no attack you will be spamming attack just to watch him spin around like a fool hitting nothing , also when you use this attack on any boss , the boss will move into an unattackable area to waste the time you have with it , I enjoy hard games but this isn‚Äôt hard it‚Äôs down right stupid.

The buttons / healing / dodging is DELAYED like a mother F it needs patching 

1. The dodge move you are given instead of block does not help in most circumstances when encountering a boss , there‚Äôs too much delay. And most time you will use direction to dodge an attack and he will dodge into the attack even though that‚Äôs not the direction u went. Delayed 

2.Healing yourself is practically a job on its own you have to be far away from your target to even think about healing yourself.delayed

3. No map makes you spend ages on YouTube or wasting time trying to find things which gets pretty boring fast.

4.you will rage at this game non stop check YouTube and TikTok and look at all the raging people so if u break controllers don‚Äôt play this game or buy 5 new controllers before you do.

5. You feel like you make no progression in this game whatsoever apart from outfit changes and weapon upgrades that make little to no difference from chapter 1 which is boring.

Only thing I noticed that's a problem is when you run into a enemy and they say some smart remark in Chinese the subtitles don't pick it up. Whilst in English u can hear what they saying. Which does suck because if you like reading subtitles. They won't pick up on the crazy things they say. Which brings me to my next thing thing. They stuff the enemy's say are hilarious. They just bash your character basically saying your a pitiful look alike and YOU AINT HIM when you lose... üòÖü§£.  You'll understand what I mean.. 1 HUGE thing I should note when playing is TIMING IS KEY.. especially with fighting.. when fighting you don't just keep hitting fast attacks. Actually u need to time your attacks when you swing your staff because there is timing delays during his swinging and twirling the staff around. Which I think is amazingly deep into detail with fighting. It progressively gets better to. Nothing to repetitive at all. I been a gamer since the 90s and I know a good game when I play one. And this game is worth the buy. Let me add when playing with the pulse 3d headphones the sounds are flawlessü§å only thing I can say I dislike the the boundaries and the invisible walls.

Games like this have big shoes to fill. When people talk about this game, they talk about games like Sekiro, Elden Ring, and God of War. And when this game started showing itself, it had‚Ä¶ so much going on. Definitely seemed like it had potential to live up to those games‚Äô names.

Story: honestly it‚Äôs tough. This is a fictional Chinese story based on Sun Wukong, a popular fable. I have next to no idea what the hell is going on, as I‚Äôve never read the book it‚Äôs based on.. but man, it‚Äôs cool as heck. The characters, the way they chime in every once in a while. I just know I‚Äôm a monkey out here trying my best. 

Gameplay: ridiculously fun. My god. When it was showing previews, I was like.. how can they do all this on a controller? But it makes sense now. The combat is fluid and promotes aggressive, quick combat. It feels like a boss rush most of the time. The enemies that aren‚Äôt bosses don‚Äôt really pose a ton of danger, but when you get to those fights.. they are cinematic and awesome. There are some small issues, some buttons don‚Äôt always react the way you want them to (there‚Äôs a move that requires L2+R2 and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt always input correctly) but it‚Äôs some of the coolest combat mechanics I‚Äôve seen in a game. Bosses are crazy. Really makes you FEEL like Wukong. 

Graphics are good on PS5. There‚Äôs definitely some issues, and you‚Äôre not going to notice any of them in chapter one. Chapter 2 and three however‚Ä¶ oh boy. You can see isometric lines when you‚Äôre walking in certain areas, small lagging situations.. in chapter three ever shrine (bonfire) you unlock has a little graphical glitch and I won‚Äôt spoil why. But I‚Äôm on chapter 4 and so far nothing has happened that‚Äôs been too much for me to not enjoy it. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs smooth about 95% of the time.

The developers want you to enjoy the journey by exploring every little secrets‚Ä¶.and the game gets easier with secrets being explored. All the chapter main bosses get help a lot easier if you manage to kill the secret boss of that chapter. Otherwise the main boss fight can be very difficult. Other than chapter six all other chapters have secret location to explore and a secret boss to fight with. If you manage to kill that boss it will drop spell or item to make your fight easier with the final boss of that chapter. The other side bosses are manageable but you need to be smart with when to face them. If you didn‚Äôt explore much and have poor items the side bosses can two three shot you. I have never played any souls like game so I cannot compare it with it but I have played god of wars. I would not compare it with god of war story wise or gameplay wise. Story wise the game is beautiful, I have to go through some explanation as I am not very familiar with the Chinese tales. I enjoyed the game a lot. Only issue is there are no maps but you can find online maps to understand the level design if you want. The only level design I didn‚Äôt like was chapter 3. Chapter 2 has a very nice level design and also the cleverer level design of all.

The fight with the staff is unique. You can change your skills and experiment however you choose to play by changing the skills without any cost. A little glitchy after chapter 2. 
Pros of the game
- Action filled game
- story was crazy 
- use of secret locations and secret tales could change your experience for the game‚Ä¶even there is a secret to the ending as well
- Defeating big bad bosses with staff was satisfying 
- Chaoter 4 and chapter 5 have a tragic tale to it. I loved the way they portrayed the tragedy 
- diverse enemy..the action didn‚Äôt feel boring as the normal enemies are very unique. I don‚Äôt know why people are saying they find it monotonous as I have never played a game with so many different types of enemies. Even god of war has lesser version of normal enemies.

Why tf am I a whole ass mythical monkey that has less agility than a 4th grade chess club enthusiast. I really wanted to like this game and there are these glimpses where it works and it works well, and I never want to be a guy that leaves a bad review just because of difficulty, but this games difficult for all the wrong reasons.

"Russell Yeo","7 months ago","I did not watch any trailers of this game, nor any of the marketing material except the first trailer. I had zero expectations coming into this, in fact, I expected this will be another run of the mill game sold based on ""amazing graphics"". I am very very pleased that I was wrong, way way wrong. I love souls likes, I love souls borne games, but they do get tiring. I was playing my yearly binge of Bloodborne just before this was released. I wanted to take a break yet at the same time I wanted a challenge still. Don't get me wrong, this is not a soulslike/soulsborne. It's a sweet blend of action RPG and Souls elements. Something akin to Jedi Fallen Order/God Of War, and reminded me quite a bit of Sekiro aesthetic wise. I played this game for 6 hours non stop, and I still wanted to continue but man's gotta work. The game performed flawlessly in performance mode on my PS5, yes there was some stutter but none of it took me out of the immersion. I was hell of immersed in this game, the opening jungle level, the graphics, the sound of the cicadas, the waterfalls, I felt like I was there and could smell the forest, not many games can do that. Combat was fun as well, like really fun, it took some getting used to the timings and the mechanics, but they were presented really well. Do not walk into this game thinking it's an open world, a souls borne. It is a unique game in itself, a really fun experience with light open world and souls experience. But take it as it is, enjoy the experience. This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. 

Disclaimer: Play it in Chinese audio, they've captured Wukong's voice really accurately from old series I've watched as a kid. And it adds to the immersion!","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."
"Jon Bradbury","5 months ago","VERY much a souls like game in the way you die a lot and upgrade by collecting 'Sparks', despite the makers claiming it isn't. Only difference is that you don't lose what you have collected and can re-spec for free. 
Minor enemies re-spawn when you rest at a shrine.

It is a linear game (not open world) so when you come up against a tough boss you can't beat then there's no way to progress. You can go and try grinding away to build your skill tree but no way to upgrade armour or weapons.

In the early game, there is a boss that's ridiculously difficult and it's either a case of 'Git gud' or give up!
(I have completed Elden Ring so not totally inexperienced in souls like - though I do understand that is probably the easiet of this genre)

As there aren't any difficulty toggle options, you can't have a 'play through' to enjoy the story - and this completely detracts from the game, to a point where you couldn't give a monkeys uncle about the character your supposed to be playing.

Saying that, there isn't really much story to actually enjoy, it's Boss Fight... a few minions.. then Boss Fight over and over again.. the only story really is 'unlocking' bits of lore to read.

There are two things i will be taking away fro  this game
1) NEVER buy a digital only game as you can't re-sell  
2) Probably don't buy a game made by Game Science","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

I‚Äôd assumed from that initial gameplay trailer years ago that the game was trying to be another souls-like, but that‚Äôs not the case. Yes, there‚Äôs similar mechanics, but when you die you‚Äôre not punished through the loss of experience or currency.

It is not open world and I‚Äôm totally fine with that. There are areas to explore in this game and you just need to take a chance by doing it.

You can always change your stats at no cost which helps against those bosses. The Yellow Wind Sage was a weird battle at some points he was on edge of screen and it wouldn‚Äôt let me get close to hit him. The escape from prison is the worst aspect of any game I have ever played, including app games. You loose health while being attacked and getting knocked back down floors while trying to escape.

The president of the company wrote his acceptance speech for game of the year 2 years before the award, instead of writing an acceptance speech he should‚Äôve paid more attention to some parts of the game especially that prison break, I almost stopped playing because of the prison break, which happens a few moments after fighting Yellow Wind Sage.

Also making you grind to get certian soaks and curious by rng was the most ridiculous idea it make the game boring and not fun. I must of kill over 1000 electric wizards to get a curious I still haven't got. Apart from that graphics and story was enjoyable. Bosses were fun apart from a few cheep ones that have the smallest hit box but can manage to hit you from anywhere on the map and just brake through your spells and waste them and the mana it uses. Game also get very laggy and clunky at some point. The thing that annoyed me is that they fix glitches (infinite mana) in there game in days which made the game very fun and funny but stuff like game play being laggy and shit to make us hate the game like the shit rng of drops they leave that why I'm leaving a low score for this game","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

It's a unique, beautiful game that isn't multi-player,  online service,  ""current trend"" gaming.  

My only complaint with the game is that it's incredibly difficult!! I don't know how many hours I've played,  but I know it's over 40+ and I just barely made it to chapter 3.

The good:
It generally looks good from an art style, color scheme and animation design standpoint.
The combat system is interesting. 
Deaths aren‚Äôt as punishing as soulsborne games and it‚Äôs quite different than a soulsborne game in many regards. 

The bad:
No mode offers a capped frame rate leading to inconsistencies in the way it runs. 
Digital foundry review shows just how many concessions were made from a technical standpoint. 
Camera angles and fov isn‚Äôt great. 
Invisible walls are prevalent and immersion-breaking. 
Hitting an enemy isn‚Äôt satisfying like it is in other top games in and out of the souls genre - it‚Äôs light and feeble feeling. 
The pacing is off, levels are narrow, overly linear, feature sparse and few regular enemies while chaining boss encounters in close succession. 
The difficulty is oppressive - not in a way that‚Äôs insurmountable but rather in a manner that‚Äôs tedious via boring repetition.
There isn‚Äôt a good variety of gear. 
Bosses have no buildup, narrative or otherwise, their frequently cheapens the experience of beating one because there‚Äôs another 2 mins away.

"Di Lu","5 months ago","Journey to the West was my childhood favorite and so I've been looking forward to this game for years. I was afraid that it'd turn out to be unfinished, and I was unfortunately right to be afraid. 
The Journey to the West lores had wonderful depths, the landscapes are gorgeous, the music and voice acting are phenomenal, and the plot takes the original story with a more explicit flavor and catch audience with nostalgic emotions. But it's very much a fighting game, not much RPG. It's ""fight endlessly for 10 hours, watch animation for 5 minutes"" and repeat that for six cycles. It has a rather linear plot, no dialogue choices to make, in fact, character developments were all written in text as background stories. Some of the bosses were lore-breakingly strong not because of narrative needs but just unbalanced mechanics. Navigation is infuriating. There's no map, and very little hints. Some areas (looking at you, pagoda jail) are buggy, where the protagonist can get stuck at places.
If you're the specific type of player that enjoy grinding domains endlessly, and occasionally read about lores, perhaps you'd enjoy ""playing"" Black Myth Wukong. Otherwise you might want to consider modding the game to get better navigation and fight mechanics just to get to all the hidden lores and secrets, while emerging in the mythical world of China... it's certainly a very specific type of fighting game, high barrier for a lot of RPG players, but for the lores and story and stunning world/acting, perhaps it's still worth time.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

It seems to be similar to the newer God of War games, with Nioh's different combat stances.

The combat is tight and rewarding, with multiple kinds of builds to suit your fancy.

Cons of the game, though few, are:
A few of the areas, while fun to explore, are a bit on the large side, and one in particular is a touch difficult to tell where you have and haven't been, leading to a few things being missed.
The difficulty is a bit weird; first half of the game is easy, but then you get hit with a difficulty spike out of nowhere that stays for most of the rest of the game.
If you are unfamiliar with Journey to the West, the story might be a bit hard to follow. I had half an idea of what was going on most of the time, I admit. Amd all the references (which the game is FULL of) mostly went over my head.
And lastly, there is no blocking mechanic, despite the Destined One using a staff. There is a parry spell, but no blocking. So you are going to want to have experience in Bloodborne and Dark Souls going into it.

"Roxx","6 months ago","I got this for free after buying a laptop. I didn't even think to preorder this game or anything but decided to try it. It's not bad. It's an action boss rush game. It has some souls like elements, but it's not a true soulslike game. For folks that may struggle with elden ring or fromsoftware games, wukong is way easier. I think it is more accessible. Boss fights are pretty decent and cinematic like. Having said that, there is no map so navigation is sometimes tricky especially when some of the levels look very similar. There isn't much of a story. It's there, but it is extremely minimal. Even Elden Ring which makes the player find out about different pieces of the lore has a better story. Wukong's story was just an afterthought at best. If you like action games or maybe even soulslike games, you'll probably like it. It won't be as difficult as fromsoftware games, but that's OK. It doesn't have to be. I'm giving it 3/5 because the story was extremely minimal and the boss rush aspect gets a bit boring after hours lol.

"shalin bhatt","5 days ago","Black Myth: Wukong ‚Äì A Disappointing Balance of Power

I had high expectations for Black Myth: Wukong, but after playing through multiple stages, I found it frustrating how the power dynamics were handled. Wukong, despite progressing through many battles, barely gets any significant upgrades. Meanwhile, every boss is overloaded with power, boasting 4-5 different abilities and extreme strength. If we compare their power, Wukong feels like he‚Äôs only at 10% of what the bosses are capable of. This imbalance makes the game feel unfair rather than challenging.

On top of that, the graphics are not as impressive as expected. Given the hype, I was hoping for something visually stunning, but the textures and details fall short, especially when compared to other PS5 games.

After playing God of War: Ragnarok, which delivers a perfect mix of gameplay, storytelling, and graphics, Black Myth: Wukong feels like a step down. The lack of proper character progression and underwhelming visuals make it hard to enjoy.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Solaire","2 months ago","The game is vast and brimming with all manner of creatures. Captivating vistas.

Unique yaoguai designs and challenging bossfights. 

Though I got a bone to pick with you. 

Certain terrains not rendering as it should, though that could be due to a limit of a PS5 hardware.

FPS drop even in performance mode. 

Furthermore, in the future you should consider ""unstucking"" enemies. For instance, in the arena where Golden Beast is he was just running into a pillar. I wish there would be special animation where he would unstuck himself by moving a bit to the right or using his hands to move in other direction. Same logic applies to regular enemies who stuck themselves looking all goofy. 

This is just a friendly remark for your future games. Maybe keep in mind that when you are creating the next chapter.

Positive: 
 Ability to use various fighting stances and special moves 
 
Graphics are very good though there were several glitches and some frame rate issues, and a couple crashes
 
 
Negatives:
 Way too many bosses: literally every 10-15min can get tiring. Their moveset is my BIG issue with this game. I've beaten Bloodborne, Darksouls 1-3, and Sekiro and found the bosses in this game to be the worst. You'll literally be dodging combos that go on and on. Then you may get a few seconds to attack before they go into another long combo where they jump to you and after the combo jump away. What's worse is the bosses keep spamming moves where they can kill you and not even be near you. I've died multiple times to bosses where they didn't have make physical contact. It's dumb moves where they damage you from far away by slamming the ground or waving some . I loved Sekiro because of the attack, parry, attack parry where you go toe to toe not get hit over and over again by attack from a mile away.

"Roman Arabia","6 months ago","Alright, so I'm playing Black Myth: Wukong on my PS5 and I'm nearing the end of chapter 4, but I wanted to share my thoughts on the game so far.

I'm very impressed by the scale of this game. It looks fantastic and the story is rich and intriguing. The voice acting is great. The enemy variety and designs are great.

I think the gameplay is very Soulslike and the style of storytelling is very God of War inspired.

On the other hand, there are some major issues. The frame rate is a slog. Sometimes I think the game is all out crashing. Button commands are completely off. I think maybe 50% of my inputs actually register. Gameplay feels stiff, delayed and clunky. The bosses have ridiculous grab and teleport attacks that can delete you instantly. Dying often feels unfair and victories don't feel earned, as most of the battles seem completely random. The difficulty feels very artificial as to be difficult for the sake of it.

Traversing the massive environments is a chore. Having access to fast travel from the pause menu or even as a consumable would have made sense. I find myself intentionally dying in order to fast track to a shrine. Seeing as the player has no map, it's easy to get turned around while exploring, especially considering most of the environments are rocks and boundaries are invisible.

The lock on system is a literal nightmare. If the enemy is whipping around the screen or teleporting it can be very disorienting. If there are multiple enemies on screen it's nearly impossible to lock on to a specific enemy without it bouncing between targets. This will cause you to miss, strike the wrong target or get you killed. Hit boxes are also extremely confusing and specific. You can be standing directly in front of a massive enemy, flailing your staff away at it and somehow miss 100% of your combo.

It's a big disappointment because I actually want to finish this game because I love its world so much but it just doesn't feel like it's worth the frustration. This is coming from someone who's beaten almost every Fromsoft game top to bottom.

I applaud game science for completing such an ambitious project, but it had the potential to be so much greater. I know Wukong has been well received so far, but it's just not for me.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

Pros:

- Graphics are amazing
- Flexibility on where to apply your stats without cost
- Variety of abilities and skills

Cons: 

- Not open world (I'm okay with), but many paths are led to invisible walls that manipulates you into thinking it's a possible path.
- There's a sense of feeling that your buttons (specifically dodging) doesn't always register. 
- Repetitive 3 or 4 enemies that you continue to kill for an entire chapter (hours and hours).
- Bosses are unnecessarily too tanky. 
- A few bosses that have made many players quit the game due to mechanically frustrating opstacles that are extremely limited to how the player can dodge, etc. 
- Not a lot of good farming areas, thus, will take you hours to achieve levels. 

Opinion: If you played Lords of the Fallen, you will find a lot of similiarities where it's a straight path game and the bosses are just unnecessarily tanky, with the very limited ability to go back and level up.

AMAZING GAME! FUN! FLASHY! NO WOKE PROPAGANDA! 

Claims of ""not enough diversity"" ? My brother in Buddha there are 107 bosses which are overwhelmingly unique each time. And like 4 in chapter 2 that are so visually stunning, you`d think you are looking at a physical manifestation of a lovecraftian beast. 

On the topic of there being ""No women"" in this game.... Are cute Asian girls not considered women nowadays? There`s a WHOLE ASS CHAPTER DEDICATED TO THEM. 

On the ""Combat is repetitive"" : Sure it can be if you go out of your way to never try new weapons (most of which encourage you to build around them) and spam the same two spells for each fight. On the technical side : Combat is smooth, fun and challenging at points. 

There is a lot to explore with a hidden area in each chapter rewarding amazing weapons and items to help you with tougher bosses should you decide to use them.

This game is going to raise the bar. It‚Äôs definitely worth the 59.99, and yes it‚Äôs a liner game but it‚Äôs HUGE, especially the second half of the game. I highly recommend it. Watch my stream on Twitch ctella315 to see me play it. It‚Äôs so fire guys I promise.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"TNT","4 months ago","Pros:
- One of the best optimized games on Unreal 5
- Fantastic combat system, very reminiscent of soulslike games with a hint of spectacle fighters such as God of War and DMC.
- Great boss design. Almost every one is a straightforward fight, with very minimal gimmicks. The hitboxes are great, as are their movesets.
- The music is surprisingly good. Not Metal Gear Rising, but good.
- The game is among the most beautiful games in terms of graphical fidelity, and art direction ever.
- The story and characters are fairly compelling, despite have minimal need to do so in a game like this. It's a admirable continuation of a centuries old tale. 

Cons:
- The weapons menu is confusing, and ultimately could use an overhaul.
- The skill and item menus cause the game to heat up, and needs to be fixed. Weirdly, the only optimization/performance problems in the game.

Conclusion: Very likely GOTY for 2024!","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

"Liam Psaila","6 months ago","Fun idea and Good visuals, thats it. Didn't know anything about Sun Wukong until this game came out but the base seemed interesting. So figured I'd give it a go, play throughs looked promising so I put in $100 to get it. However this game isn't worth the money simply put. Held back by difficault to learn combat and un rewarding boss fights. Attacks from enemies are to wild and near impossible to predict. Takes to long to progress and you feel underleveled for every chapter. A difficulty system would benefit this game greatly as the story is engaging but is hard to progress without spending 2 hours on a single boring boss fight. The map in each chapter is messy and often found myself getting lost and not knowing how to progress story. A compass feature would help tons.","You and 5 other people found this helpful.","5 people found this helpful."

"Fightingking23","6 months ago","The short answer would be the game is a solid 7/10. For the pros the game isn‚Äôt trying to be a souls like, it‚Äôs refreshing when a game in this day and age tries to be its own thing as opposed to doing what others do. The action is good, although it gets repetitive at times since you‚Äôre mostly relying on charge attacks. Light attacks serve little purpose in this game. As for major cons for me as a person who‚Äôs played and finished all from soft games and souls like games the controls are terrible. Healing is with L1 on the ps5, and i don‚Äôt have the option to change thst feature. It‚Äôs slow and unresponsive as opposed to similar games. You also don‚Äôt have a block or a parry, so most of the game your holding triangle to charge your heavy attack only to get hit with wind attacks or a roar that knocks your player down. As for controls calling the spirit is with the l2 and r2 and this is not always responsive either, for this case i would have preferred if they kept the tried snd true control scheme for this game like the others souls, demon souls, lies of p, etc. The game is also lagging on my ps5. I have used 2 ps5 and it‚Äôs lagging on both even after the first patch. Last major gripe I have is the camera angles, it needs to be improved, most of the attacks you can't see where it‚Äôs coming from against larger enemies. I‚Äôm sure if they learn from the mistakes of this game the next game csn be fantastic though.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

"Sam Yoon","6 months ago","Best game to come out in 2024. This game is now up there with the best action RPGs - Bloodborne, God of War, Sekiro, Ghosts of Tsushima, Elden Ring, and Lies of P.

First off, if you do not like any of the games up above, you may not like this game. Also it is more like Bloodborne, Sekiro, or Lies of P than God of War or GoT. If you are looking for a narrative based or open world combat rpg, this is not that game. If you do not like challenging boss battles, save your money, this game is not for you. You will need good reflexes and timing to be able to get through this. This is for people that like challenging Soulslike games.

What this game excels at is the combat, which is hella smooth, engaging, and so damn cool. Some of the most fun I have had with boss battles in any game. Right up there with FromSoft bosses and Lies of P. Some bosses may be very difficult. This game has its own flavor that stands out from all the other games in the genre. 

Also this is probably some of the best graphics and art direction I have seen on an action RPG to date. Granted I am playing this maxed out with a 4090 with Rtx hdr on an Alienware aw34dwf oled. Visuals are absolutely stunning!

"Alejandro Diaz Aragon","7 months ago","I had a lot of expectation for this game. First of all I love the story of Sun Wukong. Journey to the west is one of the literary masterpieces of China. One that has been told in many formats, including animated series, action movies and so forth. Thus I was thrilled and very excited for the game. Without hesitation I spend the entire money on it. Graphics are really amazing. Character design is also truly beautiful. Besides that I think, at least from my perspective that there are a lot of basic things left out. 

1) There is no way of diffuculty level, so you cannot change the difficulty. Well this has been there since the dawn of games. 

2) No map, but then again why would you need a map if there's actually nothing to explore. The world is extremely limited. 

3) They overdid it with the graphics. It takes a lot of GPUs to process all those hair textures. Too many hair textures, no many things to process graphically. I think even best GPUs could struggle a little bit with this.

4) Fight system is good but not the best. Only evading, no way to block or even counter. This is also basic in fighting games and sadly not present here. 

5) No story...At least so far I haven't seen enough story content and cinematics. The kind I would expect from such a big title. 

6) There are issues with graphics and due to high GPU requirements performance is affected resulting in lags.

I mean is Sun Wukong the monkey king!!! I feel they should've made this game for all audiences. Children and adults. A pleasent and ejoyable game for the family. But instead it is focus in a very specific game play based on difficult boss fights. Gets boring really quick. Basically if you cannot beat the boss you cannot advance. Boss after Boss. To beat each boss you probably have to die several times until you figure how to evade the attacks and the right strategy to kill them. When I say strategy I mean mainly memorizing the bosses attacks, cause you cannot use strategy actually. Something like fight a fire boss with water is not here. Entirely mechanical and there are issues with the mechanics.  This gets boring, frustrating and is not for everyone. I am dissapointed, Sun Wukong is my hero!","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."

You can't cheese bosses or use overpowered builds to win. Overall, a good entry in the action RPG genre. The boss fights are the best if not some of the best in any video game.

The gameplay is awesome. Storyline so far is straightforward but overall the game deserves so much of respect. On the con side, the game has glitches especially during boss fights even on performance mode on PS5. I hope the developers can fix it on an update

Edit: I changed my review from 4 to 3 stars because of how buggy this game is. Fighting the Chapter 2 main boss had so many glitches and the lag from the actions of pressing the buttons. Sometimes I dodge but the action is performed a couple of seconds later causing all the difference in the fight.

Take your time and don‚Äôt bask in defeat. Learn how each boss operates, respawn 20x, up until you finally taste the sweet victory, then carry on with the well deserved tale. It is worth it. Worth the shift in gameplay.

Graphic are ok. I'm a couple hours in. Game isn't very hard. Death by environment more than anything else. This is NOT a souls like game at all, with the exception being shrines (like bonfires or embers). Outrageously priced for what feels like an outdated game. 

No stealth of any kind. No climbing walls or buildings (he's a fk'n monkey). No blocking or riposte from what I have played so far, just dodge-dodge-attack combos for each and every enemy. 

Main characters voice sounds like mine... when I was 12 and going through puberty.if you think that's cool, you should be in prison, not playing video games. 

 No cool cutscenes or boss backstories. Just ""I have a big health bar. You can't leave now. Roll around a bunch and swing your stick at me until I'm dead."" 

It's colorful (if you like green). 

I won't say it's not worth playing. I'm 100% saying wait until it's on sale or used copies flood your local gamestop.

"Steven Chan","6 months ago","This is the worst and most frustrating game ever. Graphics, gameplay and storyline are amazing, only to be ruined by the high level of difficulty, and there isn't even a difficulty setting! Spent hours upon hours just to defeat one boss, only to find out that the game has a hundred bosses. Nope, no thank you. If I wanted to do something repetitive and mundane, my time could be better spent doing something productive like the chores, or laundry, or dishes, or the gym.

To be fair, I am not a frequent gamer, and bought this game just to see what the hype is all about. Maybe an avid gamer would be able to better appreciate elements of the game, but for someone as uninitiated such as myself, this game is simply overly frustrating and repetitive, and in all honesty, just a waste of time and money.

For those of you who do not know, this is mainly a boss fighting game, where you fight one boss after another over and over again. Open world exploration, while present, is not the core focus of the game. You can imagine how repetitive the game is, where you will spend insane amounts of hours and an ungodly number of attempts just to defeat one boss, only to meet the next boss 10 minutes later. So just as a fair warning before buying the game - be prepared that you will spend countless numbers of hours facing the same opponents over and over again, especially given how insanely difficult the game is.","You and 13 other people found this helpful.","13 people found this helpful."

The game play is quite repetitive but also quite addictive. At times it is extremely frustrating. I'm not into souls style games, and people are saying certain bosses on black myth are harder than the hardest bosses on the likes of elden ring. Later in the game a couple of bosses probably took me 3+ hours each. And I was ready to throw my controller through my window a few times.  I stuck at it and managed to defeat them all, but i wouldnt say these were enjoyable experiences.  However there is a certain level of achievement you feel when you defeat these bosses that you don't feel in your easier games. Definitely taught me some lessons in perseverance.

It's hard for me to give it 5 stars, because at times it frustrated me so much. But having completed it about 4 days ago, I do find myself missing it.

My main issues being performance issues likely due to ur5 and bugs in the game. There are times the dodge button doesn't work which is ridiculous. And though the next thing I'm about to mention only happened during 1 boss fight it almost made me want to quit the game. The attack button just stopped working. And no it wasn't due to something the boss did like an ability that doesn't allow me to attack. The camera can also definitely be an issue at times during boss fights. Your defense also relies almost entirely on dodging. Nope no blocking or traditional parry. (The rock ability you get later in the game somewhat acts as a parry).

"Ysmn Zdn","6 months ago","To be very honest, I feel embarrassed having to write this because reading all the reviews, everyone has amazing things to say. I have too but I have more not so nice things to say which I feel, hopefully the creators are able to take in consideration. 

For starters, not everyone who plays game is a pro gamer. I am definitely not a pro gamer however I do love playing games as a form of relaxing especially on overwhelming days. I feel like this game is specifically catered to pro gamers when they excluded the difficulty modes. I am not sorry that I am not as good as most out there who are able to get through the boss battles, and it is extremely frustrating for me when I have to be stuck on a boss battle for days. 

I am playing it on PS5 and the graphics, without a doubt is amazing, top tier. I only encountered one crash where I had to restart the whole console as I was spending too much time on a specific boss. 

Simple things like the path is filled with enemies before a boss battle can take up so much time and life, which should not be the case since a boss battle is called a boss battle for a reason. I am just really upset for spending, and this is not a cheap game ya, only to end up spending days before being able to proceed to the next part. 

As it is so frustrating, I am only able to watch these pro gamers online just to see how the story goes because sadly, I just cannot seem to move on from a particular boss at such an early stage when my built is not that great yet. So if the built given is not that experienced yet, why am I given a boss battle at an early start that seems impossible to beat? 

One example would be the serpent guy. Yes, that is the one I am still stuck on. How is it fair with such a low built I am already having difficulty killing this fella, only to have him transform to a more difficult form and him having full health while I am down to no more refilling of health + 1/4 life left? Yes, I have seen how to try to beat this demon and yet I just cannot get past it. I am just so shattered as I really do want to complete the game. 

Again, this is my opinion, not everyone has to agree. The concept is great, the execution really not wow. So all the best to me, hoping one day I can get over that demon but for now, I really hate that guy.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

I've recently downloaded the game. The graphics are great no doubt about it and there is a good story in it. Along the start of the game everything was ok and interesting but as you progress to the first boss, the game becomes hardcore difficult to the point that the game is literally unplayable.

Good graphics
A bit of a story

Cons

Game has no modes for difficulty and literally is hardcore
Too time consuming

So if you're someone who just wants to enjoy a good game, this is not a game for you. It's difficult to the point that it's just another frustrating game.","You and 3 other people found this helpful.","3 people found this helpful."

"Devan Bryant","6 months ago","Game looks great but the mechanics work against you. Having a counter as a part of your combo doesnt really create a fun experience. It‚Äôs unreliable and doesnt work most of the time due to the timing of it being executed wont match up with the enemies attack. Dodging doesnt really seem too accurate due to me dodging right before an attack hits me and i still take the hit. However the perfect timing seems to be at the exact moment you are hit which doesnt make sense. The maps are filled with empty corners and mostly just contain currency which isnt a hard item to come by. Often times i can try to activate a spell in combat but the input delay is so terrible that you will die trying.  The game is good but the combat isnt. Obviously not a good thing for this.

"Mustafa Yousif","6 months ago","This game had the visuals, but honestly, it was more stress than fun. Sure, the graphics were impressive, even if they sometimes dropped on PS5, but that‚Äôs not the main issue. The real problem? The insanely hard bosses. No matter how much you level up, it doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äì the next boss will wipe the floor with you. You spend hours grinding, leveling, thinking you're stronger, but it‚Äôs like every boss just resets the difficulty. The first boss felt as hard as the 80+ ones. What‚Äôs the point of leveling if it means nothing?

And the end? Look, when I play a game, I want to enjoy the journey and feel some sense of closure when it‚Äôs over. But instead, I spent four days of pure stress and anxiety trying to beat the final Wukong boss. When I finally won, I didn‚Äôt feel joy or accomplishment ‚Äì just relief that it was over. But then, surprise! There‚Äôs an even harder boss, Erlang, waiting for you. At that point, I was done. I didn‚Äôt even want to fight him. I watched the fight on YouTube just to get some kind of closure without losing my mind.

It‚Äôs like they forgot games are supposed to be fun! Why not just add difficulty options? Not everyone wants to sweat through every fight just to prove something.

I found the game to be very two dimensional in it's play style. Most of the game is going from boss to boss, with little else to do. 

Boss fighting is generally very fun in games, but not when it's the ONLY thing. There were many points where you would fight 1 to 4 normal enemies between each boss. 

Bosses are realitively different, but with limited move sets and combat styles the fighting quickly felt stale. 

It would be a great benefit to the game to add a stronger story line, side objectives, or more opportunities to explore the map. Additionally having a map would probably be a step in the right direction.","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

"Giichi","6 months ago","I would LOVE to meet the game testers (if they had any). Let me explain...

Without blocking or infinite Stamina & Mana you are going to go through a shit ton of loses. The Bosses (which are 90% of the game) are overpowered and are magnetized to you when they attack. Your inputs are delayed even though they are timed properly. When you attack you aren't magnetized to them as they are, so you miss most of your opportunities. Your damage is lil to none which means you have to get all up in their grill, which for most, is impossible. 

Your gourd replenish gets interrupted even though the devs stated it cannot be. You cannot double jump so even jumping during a sweep attack can kill you. Your dodges are delayed, causing problems with the bosses that just go full on rage mode (that's all of them btw). And when you do manage to defeat them you only get a SINGLE Spark (that helps you upgrade). You need at least 5 so you get yourself a proper beef up as Mana upgrades cost 2.

Visually, its fantastic. Sadly, alot of fighting and lil story. You hardly get a break and when you do get a cutscene it hardly lasts 3 full minutes. Meditation spots are also in strange places. They tried to do a Ghost of Tsushima type of game and they missed on so many aspects.

If you think about it where's the replay value if its so hard to beat in the first place. also the final boss.  Devs im begging you make him easier this is coming from a elden ring player. for starters.

"Amog Shetty","3 months ago","I went into Black Myth: Wukong with high expectations, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The pacing is completely off, and the gameplay revolves entirely around endless boss fights. There‚Äôs no exploration, no engaging side content, and nothing to break up the monotony of the constant battles. It feels like a loop of boss fight trailers stitched together, and it becomes boring and frustrating very quickly.

The difficulty level is absurd, making the boss fights feel almost unwinnable. Wukong is always under-leveled, and the gameplay punishes you rather than rewarding skill or strategy. It‚Äôs frustrating to play a character that feels weak and underpowered the entire time.

To make things worse, there‚Äôs no story to connect with Wukong as a character. Without a proper narrative, I felt no attachment to him or his journey. It just felt like I was playing a hollow shell of a character with no growth or purpose. The game offers no sense of progression, and the constant cycle of fight after fight with no payoff left me wondering what the point even was.

In the end, Black Myth: Wukong is all style and no substance‚Äîa visually impressive game that fails to deliver any meaningful or enjoyable experience.

I can literally deal with all of that, if I could move after being hit once, not after getting hit 5 times and than get up like a 90 year old woman who just broke her back from falling down 20 flights of stairs.","You and 7 other people found this helpful.","7 people found this helpful."
"Dylan Griffiths","4 months ago","Brilliant RPG. Was skeptical before buying as was told it was just a boss rush and no open world. How wrong people are. If, like me, you love a souls like game then buy it. It's similar most to Sekiro which is my favourite. The only quarm I have with the game is the loading times. Very long considering it's a PS5 game. No complaints otherwise","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

"Dan Thompson Bateria","7 months ago","I loved the first hour of the game and it got me so hyped. I thought to myself ""this is gonna be something just like Elden Ring"" but NO.

Man, after that first hour, that was it, the game was the same, not much to explore or to do. The gameplay is so repetitive, is just fight after fight and some bosses in the process.

What got me so disappointed was the lack of detail (not talking about the graphics). I mean, you can craft your armor at the check point, and you can buy stuff as well at the check point. I mean, is it so hard to make a work bench somewhere in the map to give it more sense about crafting your armor? Or create a merchant to give it more sense of you buying stuff? They didn't even bother with that. To me that's just lazy.

This game is all graphics and nothing else. There is so much that needs to be done in this game to make it more enjoyable that I can't believe after all these years in the making this is what they came up with.

I even gave up after I heard the game is only 35hrs long, The Last of Us part 2 is longer than that and they thought about every single detail possible to put in the game, which is why is my favourite game. 

Literally a full let down.","You and 33 other people found this helpful.","33 people found this helpful."

I wish just to enjoy the gameplay, its story line and it's visual immersion but I cannot seem to get past the third mini boss and each battle was like an eternity for me. There's no option to change the level of difficulty either. I know some enjoy the difficulty and challenges that come with it but I wish there's an easy setting for a lame sad gamer like myself!

For example, one  boss was running around without health and dealt damage till i lost. Dodging is too slow sometimes rather than others as it was programmed that way to make things ""harder"".. Foes become incredibly stronger at extremely low health to the point where you can't give them that final hit to destroy them. Games should be fun not frustrating. I don't understand the trend of recent years with making games incredibly unplayable to the point of either abandoning them or breaking the TV.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

It took very creative gameplay, cool spells and beautiful graphics and completely f*** up the compatibility with the actual boss fighting. The only way to play this game is to play each boss over and over again until you memorize it (ex: you can‚Äôt see a move coming and dodge it, you have to know when they‚Äôre going to use an attack and anticipate it.

3. The game is short, not much to explore
4. Graphics is nice but its pointless if the gameplay is bad
5. The game just doesn't have enough to keep me going. It could be a combination of uninteresting storyline and characters and mediocre gameplay.

Like why didn't the game add difficulty options? It made no sense. Just because the graphics were good and the ai of the enemies was good doesn't mean everything else should be dog shit. How can the game spend so much money on the graphics, effects, and AI but not even create a simple story or add difficult settings for gamers who aren't good at fighting?

Dodging and healing this game is so annoying. 9/10 the dodges don‚Äôt work and the healing requires you to actually see the animation play out to actually heal. 2. There needs to be a map on the game. A game this big just needs it. 3. The fact that it is more like a souls game instead of a rpg. I for one gate playing copies of other games. This game should be its own game not just a copy of another game. I would give the game a five star if the mechanics worked better, and it had a map in the game. I don‚Äôt mind the difficulty when the game is difficult because of level requirements or stuff like that not because of having to be perfect with the timing of dodges that don‚Äôt work properly.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

PROS
- Visually stunning

CONS
- Bosses attack with no pause, and their attacks are fast, powerful, wide range, accurate, and frequent.
- The window of perfect dodging is too tight.
- Invisible walls.
- Some bosses seem to have invisible walls in front of them that are thicker than the length of The Chosen One's staff.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Also, the input delay! What is this? Takes forever to dodge or to heal.

This game is super overrated and over hyped. The more you play the more you see how fromsoftware is light years a head of the other developers.

Finally, the developers have baited us by saying the game is like god of war. It is brutal souls like game.

Levels and equipment is arbitrary, stats don‚Äôt matter. Some RPG this is. No co-op. Tutorial is non-existent. Game throws terms at you that isn‚Äôt explainedor is described terribly. UI is unreadable because the game never tells you what the icons are. Abilities have extreme cool down that make them effectively one-time use. Bosses are hyper aggressive and will two shot you. They teleport constantly and because of the bad camera you won‚Äôt see most of their attacks. Gameplay is too fast, leaving you with a microsecond to respond.

It is a combination of Jade Empire, God Hand, Parasite Eve 2, Onimasha 1, Chaos Legion, Evil Within, and the God of War series. It is a highly addictive game.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Marty","6 months ago","The player experience is sub-par. The game has no difficulty setting and is made extremely difficult to make the game play longer and one dimensional. The flow of story or game play is severely impacted by this. No map is not an experience, asking player to go on line to find map or hand drawn is plain stupid.  Cold, fire, poison damage are all half baked ideas and seemed not necessary. Lack of new idea is all I experienced. God of war is a much better game in everyway‚Ä¶","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."
"Mehdi Bey","6 months ago","Visualy very nice, unfortunately it's the only thing positive that can be said, also it's  always the same kind of landscape , the fight are very basic , you have two strikes , light and a heavier one, no counter strikes, you fight bosses all the time , if you loose you'll have to start from almost the beginning to fight the boss again,  thats very annoying, there is no side missions or anything like it , it's not an open world  blocked with invisible walls , you just go through a fight to another fight, it's so linear.
Basically it's one of the most boring game I ever played, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."
"King Kage","6 months ago","Honestly the game play is slow. The bosses are incredibly OP. A couple shots and you‚Äôre dead. The dodge button is a joke. Even if you dodge with certain enemies you still get hit. To me this was a waste of money in my opinion. You don‚Äôt even do much damage. It‚Äôs crazy. Even the smaller enemies will kill you in a few strikes. I‚Äôm going back to CFB25","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

It's just okay. 2.7 out of 5. The framerate isn't too stable on PS5. The camera movement isn't consistent either, with you basically constantly trying to look ahead. No difficulty settings is weird. Some bosses are hilariously easy, while others and hilariously difficult.","You and 8 other people found this helpful.","8 people found this helpful."

The gameplay is frustrating ‚Äî enemy damage is much higher than your attack damage, and when you die, you have to start over from a manually saved checkpoint. It feels like a waste of money.

"Adam Casey","6 months ago","The game is too hard with an uninteresting and opaque story line. The world is beautiful to look at but very limited. There's not much to explore. It's hard to find anything rewarding in this. Be prepared to die hundreds of times before killing big bosses. I really don't understand what people see in this game. The repetition of die/revive is boring and frustrating. I wish I could get my money back.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."
"Austin Wiles","5 months ago","Fun game... until you realize most of the bosses are artificially difficult. Many bosses are damage sponges and do not appeal to the player base when it comes to fights. The bosses seem very cool at first, then you realize that you're going to be stuck on the boss for the next who knows how long... just like the last boss, and the one before that, etc. Overall it takes away from the enjoyment of the game and should definitely be taken caution of in the future of this series.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The only thing this game has going for it is the graphics. It only has one difficulty level, and the constant boss fights are extremely hard. The game is not open world and the linear playthrough gets boring real quick. Leveling up and crafting are basically non existent. I could honestly go on and on about how disappointing it is.

The developers really missed an opportunity with this one.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."
