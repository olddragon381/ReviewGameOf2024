It's hard to find any review scoring it below a nine, with most giving it a solid 10. And it‚Äôs not just critics ‚Äì almost everyone I know who's played Astro Bot is raving about it, claiming it should be a clear frontrunner for Game of the Year. I recently finished it, and naturally, I started to wonder ‚Äì does Astro Bot truly live up to all the hype?

Honestly, yes! From the first trailer, I was hooked. It looked like a classic, fun platformer ‚Äì simple, creative, colorful, and full of charm. And after playing it, I can confirm that it matched my expectations. It‚Äôs pure fun, through and through.

One common criticism I‚Äôve seen is that Astro Bot is essentially a glorified ad for PlayStation, and yeah, that‚Äôs true. But it‚Äôs still an incredibly enjoyable game. It‚Äôs like a nostalgic trip down memory lane, filled with references and cameos from PlayStation classics like Ape Escape and Jak and Daxter. Even though Sony hasn‚Äôt done much with these franchises in recent years, Astro Bot reminds us just how great these old games were. You even find nods to other titles like Bloodborne, which adds a fresh twist to the experience.

Astro Bot‚Äôs levels are highly creative, offering power-ups that enhance gameplay beyond the usual punch and jump mechanics. You can pick up cool gadgets like frog boots that let you shoot explosives or a time-stopping watch for solving puzzles. The boss fights are fun, the secret and challenge levels add more depth, and overall, it‚Äôs a simple yet engaging experience. It only took me about seven hours to finish the main story, though if you're aiming for 100% completion, you‚Äôll likely spend closer to 10-12 hours.

I genuinely can‚Äôt think of anything the game does poorly. The controls are tight, the visuals are fantastic, and the physics are impressive. Each level feels distinct, filled with creativity and style. If I had to nitpick, the game might feel too short for some, but I personally think it‚Äôs the perfect length.

While I do believe Astro Bot is a strong contender for Game of the Year, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a guaranteed win. It‚Äôs been an incredible year for games. For me, Astro Bot ranks in my top three, just behind Black Myth: Wukong and Space Marine 2. But it‚Äôs still a game that almost anyone can pick up and enjoy, regardless of their gaming background.

Now, if you‚Äôre someone who prefers more narrative-heavy or action-packed games, Astro Bot might not be your cup of tea. But if you enjoy puzzle-solving and platforming, you‚Äôll likely find it objectively great. The music, especially in the boss levels, is phenomenal ‚Äì some of the tracks are just fantastic.

In short, Astro Bot is absolutely worth buying. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying a PlayStation 5 just to play it. It‚Äôs a must-have if you already own the console, but it‚Äôs not the kind of game that will make you rush out and spend a ton of money just to experience it. Nonetheless, for those who do have a PS5, this is a must-own title that will bring you plenty of joy during its 10-12 hours of gameplay.","You and 70 other people found this helpful.","70 people found this helpful."

This game makes me feel like that kid opening up his first ps1 on Christmas and popping in crash bandicoot for the first time all over again!

I never leave reviews on here, but Holy smokes is this game awesome! I'm someone who never buys games brand new. Typically most modern games are buggy when they release and it's usually better for me personally to wait until they go on sale later on and have had majority of the bugs patched by that point instead of paying full price for a broken game. This is the 1st game I've pre ordered, let alone bought brand new in years (I honestly think the last game I pre ordered was black ops 2 lol). After playing the astro game that came with the ps5, I knew this was going to be great because that last game was an amazing experience, and boy, this one did not disappoint! Amazing soundtrack, amazing attention to detail, pretty much every single thing in the game can be interacted with, and I still have not encountered 1 bug. Plus, it's just all-around fun, enjoyable game play. This is modern gaming done right, which is what led me to support it by pre-ordering it. We need to show these game developers what kind of expectations we want our games to live up to by showing them with our wallets. This developer gave us an amazing game for $60 instead of $70 (unless you got the digital deluxe version like myself, which is then only $70 and you get the soundtrack, an avatar pack, and special skins), no paying extra for dlc, everything included woth your initial purchase (at least as of now), and took their time to ensure we would have a good experience without having a buggy mess of a game upon release. This is a team that actually cared about its fan base and it shows. Kudos to the development team that worked on this.

I feel like this game is a mixture of young and old, innovative yet nostalgic, and overall a delight to play. I cant seem to stop playing it, actually. I'll put it down and do something around the house, and feel the need to want to collect more bots, and grab my PS5 components to get my little guys back home! 

The nostalgia you feel is surreal- taking you back  in time to when you were a kid during Christmas with your PS1 and Crash Bandicoot. There's a seriously special feeling each time I discover a new and unique ""Bot"" to add to my collection. The worlds are designed around the main character Bots and it feels like its own unique game in each world. 

I seriously doubt there will be another game that tops this for the remainder of the year. With the soundtrack, the diversity, the uniqueness and overall tone of the game- it's its own behemoth cemented in the platforming genre that is now entirely unrivaled. I couldn't think of a better way to spend $69.99 (I got the Deluxe Edition because I'm a huge fan of the souls games and wanted the Bloodborne outfit and avatar)

If your kids are looking for a game for the holiday season this year, highly recommend picking up Astro Bot for them. If you're an OG PlayStation gamer like myself, do yourself a favor, and pick it up. You will most certainly not be disappointed. I also highly recommend you play it on an OLED TV/Monitor, the colors pop on my Alienware AW2725DF.

Bravo, Sony. After a catastrophic failure that was ""Concord"", you really made up for it here with Astro Bot.","You and 40 other people found this helpful.","40 people found this helpful."

I've played Astro's Playroom, and if you have aswell you'll know how good the graphics are and how amazing it feels. Well I have news: Astro Bot is 10 times better. 
The unlimited creativity brings the charactars to life. There is no diologue, but you know exactly what each individual charactar is thinking. The relationship between Astro and the CPU is both hilarious and sweet, and his strong relationships with the other bots, as you will see at the end of the game. 

Astro bot is a masterpeice, up there in the top 5. It is clear that the developers had the playere best interest at heart, as you will see throughout the game. For example, when you collect the ship parts, the GPU, Memory, Cooling fan and SSD all sing together. There's a little place for astro to stand where it focuses the camera on the adorable proformance and even after you cover them over with the white coverings they fold away when nearby so you can still listen. 
The bots have super cute animation and personalities, finding them all is no simple task. Some puzzles are very difficult to solve, but NEVER difficult in an annoying way. I was engaged during every step of Astro's journy. 

Boss fights were INCREDIBLE. 2 had MIND BLOWING ends, which often involves some overwhealmingly huge obsticle or just really good animation that will make you go, 'WOW!' The bosses often take afew attempts but they're really creative and learning how to expose the boss's weak points are an engaging way to spend replays. 

FROM HERE, MAJOR SPOILERS

The alien boss at the end was probably the best. Spinning the wheel to pick your chosen abilities was an absoloutley amazing idea, this means the boss can be played in more than one way. It's so emotional at the end (TURN BACK, MAJOR SPOILER! IT'S RIGHT AHEAD! BE CAREFUL!)
When the alien grabs astro and tries to drag him down... Masterful. I appreciated the fact that a normal bot grabbed his hand and that showed how brave and amazing the 'common bots' are. Astro seeing them all struggling to help him... Then letting go of them and allowing himself to be taken away and killed... I have never felt so much for a fictional robot. It was also so adorable how the CPU was giggling at astro as he set her free, and at the end when he needed a heart. The bots turning to her, cheering at her to give him the heart, was just so funny.

I bought this because I was feeling down and wanted to play something light hearted. I got so much more. This is the best game I've played all year. The level design is phenomenal. The sound and hardware design with the controller is spectacular. The graphics are truly beautiful and next gen. The cinematics of the PlayStation are a bit extra in the beginning, but after that this game has so many awesome and original gameplay mechanics. This game feels like the golden years of platform gaming and honestly stands up against my favorite platformers from Nintendo and Sega. 

Not only that there are some really cool redirects given to ask the major exclusive PlayStation games over the last 30 years. You even get to play as some of them on specific levels. My favorite so far being God of War. 

Even the home world that filled with bots is enthralling because of the easy you can interact with them in a meaningful way that honors a specific character's legacy.

The gameplay mechanics are incredibly tight, making every moment feel precise and satisfying. The game fully utilizes the PS4 controller in clever ways, accompanied by great music and a simple yet engaging narrative that kept me glued to the screen.

I completed the game and earned the Platinum Trophy in 23 hours, and honestly, I was left wanting more. I‚Äôm eagerly hoping for some DLC!

Other highlights include near-instantaneous load times, impressive attention to detail, and a highly addictive gameplay loop of rescuing lost bots, hunting down puzzle pieces, discovering secret areas, and unlocking new looks for both Astro and the controller.

The throwbacks to platformer games such as Banjo Kazooie to me are palpable in the design and sense of discovery within this game. It's a game that just feels so cool to be in, each world has such a cool sense of discovery and nostalgia to it - supported so well by a really great soundtrack, inlcuding numerous songs that have been stuck in my head for multiple days now. I genuinely wouldn't want to miss a gem like this. I feel like it would be really difficult to not enjoy this game! I sincerely hope to see more of these games in the future, the level design and consistent demonstration of creativity on display is fantastic.

Our unfortunate titular Astro Bot gets his PS5 ship wrecked by a space bully alien during a journey, leaving all the parts (and Astro Bot's little friends) scattered throughout the small cosmos covered by the game. Astro Bot must now set upon journey to recover all the PS5 components and rescue the Bots trapped across a myriad of planets.

My first impression with Astro Bot is that it actually made me feel young again, because this game's levels of cuteness rival those of Kirby's (even if this game's more Mario-ish), especially with the PS5 controller making noises to accompany what goes on close-up.

You have your simple 3D Platforming traits, those being the gameplay and stylistic visuals, thrown into this game, making the family-friendly nature all the more fitting. Some worlds, which vary in nature, will give you bonus abilities which you can take advantage of so as to not make the simplistic gameplay feel way too tired. The boss fights are pretty cool here too, and you get three chances on the same run before you have to restart the fight.

This adventure is the cutest way to celebrate a PlayStation milestone out there (that case being 30 years of the console brand), with some of the bots you rescue resembling PlayStation characters (Whether first-party or made famous on the console) adding to the PlayStation-y aesthetic of this incredible game that every PS5 owner should buy.

Game of the Year, well-deserved.

Astro‚Äôs Playroom was awesome, and this is that on steroids. It‚Äôs the Playstaion‚Äôs Super Mario Galaxy. This is one of those games that I‚Äôm happy to pay full price for. It‚Äôs $60 and not 70 which is another W. As gamers, we need to support these kinds of games. This is a fun, complete experience that doesn‚Äôt waste your time and money. No microtransactions, no season pass or battle pass, no roadmap, there‚Äôs a deluxe upgrade but no gold, ultimate, complete, collector‚Äôs edition nonsense, and no need for a hundred patches and updates because the game works on day 1. 

And on top of all that, the game is just a good time to play, straight up. Just pick up the controller and go, nice and simple. It's all about fun, which is what gaming should be.  

If you're as tired of money-eating gaming trends as I am, buy Astro Bot. Vote with your wallet. Please enjoy this wonderful game, which has had so much love and passion put into it. It's an obvious must-play if you're a Playstation fan, a platformer fan, or if you just wanna have fun. As someone who's played most of the games that are honored in Astro Bot, I feel like it was made just for me. It's a love letter to the last 30 years of Playstation excellence.

Astro Bot is a fantastic game but at the end it's a game that's just meant to promote the power of the PS5 and what the haptic feedback abilities of the PS5 controller could do.  It has a nice touch of showing us Bot representation of various Ip's that were introduced to gamers on the Playstation consoles throughout the generations from Crash Bandicoot and Jax to Kratos and Aloy.  The game does shows us how well the controllers haptic feedback works as you go from galaxy to galaxy traversing worlds(Aka Super Mario Galaxy) saving lost Bots and trying to find the lost parts to your Playstation Console ship.  The mini-bosses and main bosses are fun to take on but overall it just feels like Astro Room 2.0. at the end.  Still I don't have any regrets getting the game and do have fun playing through each level and willingly I don't mind paying the $60 for the gameas overall gamers will have a ton playing this game and has decent replay ability.

Even Astrobot, a small tiny toy like character has so much personality. I was so attached by the end of the game.

I played the first Astro's playroom and it was pure joy from start to finish. The soundtrack is super catchy and fun and the graphics are exactly what Nintendo is missing out on. I see some negative reviews saying that this game is just a Mario clone and is far too difficult for kids game, but in my opinion those people just need to get better at one of the easiest genres of games. Just because it doesn't have an ESRB rating above T or M doesn't mean anything either, it honestly feels like people are just trying to validate themselves playing video games with higher age ratings. This is the exact kind of game Sony has been needing after all these years.

EDIT: I have just finished 100% the game and honestly I still agree with my review. Yes, the challenge levels are very difficult but never feel impossible. The controls are buttery smooth and are very responsive. I noticed 0 frame rate drops and no input lag, but my controller's audio output did stutter from time to time but it was no game-breaking deal. Did it deserve GOTY? While yes I do think that Astro Bot is a near perfect experience, I can't deny the other great games on show. I feel like Astro Bot did deserve it in the end because it was a huge wake up call not just for Sony but the whole games industry as a whole.

I knew it was going to be a classic instantly. Safe to say, I was not disappointed one bit. Astro‚Äôs Playroom was already a blast enough, though, Astro Bot is much more complete as well as improved. The features and unique aspects of Astro‚Äôs Playroom are perfectly expanded. With all the new added abilities, the fun that comes from this title is unlimited.

Here's the gist:

- Nostalgic and New: It's a trip down memory lane with fresh gameplay.

- Tactile Magic: The DualSense made every touch feel real.

- Detail-Oriented: Every corner of the game feels alive.

- Emotional: Astro feels like a friend, not just a character.

- Shareable Joy: Made me want to share every discovery.

- Technically Impressive: Smooth, stunning, and responsive.

- Immersive Sound: Audio that enhances every moment.

- Comfortingly Innovative: Old friend with new tricks.

In short, Astro Bot is a heartfelt reminder of why we love gaming, crafted with passion and care.","You and 2 other people found this helpful.","2 people found this helpful."

(2024) 

4/5 Stars

- a short but sweet extraterrestrial extravaganza 

I completed the main story and avoided the subreddit to dodge spoilers. Astro Bot was definitely a great game‚Äîit's up there with titles like Rayman Origins, Super Mario Galaxy, and maybe even Super Mario Sunshine for me.

That said, I do wish the game had some quality-of-life improvements, particularly with UI It would be nice to have a button in the pause menu that lets you access
features like costumes instantly. I also haven't experienced many bugs, except for one instance where a bot was clipped into the wall, but that only happened once. Shout out to the playtesters!

I don‚Äôt understand why some people are against the idea of the game coming to PC. To each their own. 

Overall, the game is excellent. I‚Äôd give it a 4/5‚Äîan update could easily make it a 5/5 for me.","You and 4 other people found this helpful.","4 people found this helpful."

They added so many new features that Astro can do, more bad guys that we have never seen before. Granted the Alien and the Gorilla (that I've seen so far) are repeat Bosses but in this gorilla boss fight, it's way different and it's worth the wait and the thrill. Especially if you're a fan of the soundtrack. If you bought the digital special edition for the extra $10 it comes with the soundtrack and a bunch of cool photos. The game is literally so huge that it's mind boggling. It's like if you took rescue mission, Astro's playroom combined the two but made the game 4x as big. You have worm holes and apparently we have a chameleon boss similar to how you had to find the hidden chameleons in rescue mission.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Fundamentally, it is very fun.

The graphics are so polished and well done.

It‚Äôs overflowing in creativity and ideas.

There is a lot to collect, and the level design is excellent.

The use of the controller and the music are unmatched.

It‚Äôs mostly relaxing, but there are some levels thrown in which will be very challenging, if not impossible, to some casual gamers. The final challenge level (for bot 301) will make some want to break their TV).

Honestly, if this game doesn‚Äôt win game of the year, something is rigged.

I genuinely feel like this outshines the best Mario game (Galaxy/Odyssey), or at least matches it.

I hope it sells aplenty. This is what gaming has been needing.","You and 6 other people found this helpful.","6 people found this helpful."

The melody paired with a simple; albeit catchy, verse proclaiming to ‚Äúbe‚Äù this animated metal space-being engulfed the surrounding air around me. Hearing this small robot announce his sure-footedness in his confidence of him knowing just who he is made me scoff at the thought of such an underwhelming and thoughtfully generic character being so bold. I swore then on that very day that I did in fact dislike this so called cosmic bipedal android. It was at that moment my companion shared a joke. Providing the notion that it was all a ruse, that none other than myself so happened to be an admirer of Asto Bot. Scoff ‚Äògain I did. Irrefutably knowing my own personal stance on the figure. Sneeringly playing along I claim to one day own a Sony Playstation 5, conquer the challenge bestowed by Astro Bot, and finally give my report on the quality of this game, knowing all too well it could only result in being 1/5 stars.

Astro Bot reminds me of playing Super Mario 64 for the first time in Toys'R'Us on the display N64. It has a huge amount of charm, amazing graphics, some great use of the haptic feedback on the controller. You are collecting Bots and exploring different worlds. It's basically an old school platformer with super charged graphics. 

Astro Bot, WuKong and Shadow of the Erdtree are my personal games of the year. This is such a beautiful throw back - well done Sony Japan. 10/10 for me.

I played Astro Bot until I achieved the Platinum trophy out of pure spite for having played the game at all, since PlayStation doesn‚Äôt allow a refund after you‚Äôve played it even for a minute. Spoilers ahead.

For starters, a premium price of $60+ for this one is extremely steep, considering they seem to have simply copied the exact templates and assets and sound effects as the previous game. Alas, I purchased it thinking it would be a cool story, maybe a more in-depth platformer than just jumping and running and swinging through a linear level. ‚ÄòTis not. No sprint button in this semi-open world game, in this day and age? The music was painfully repetitive and the bass is way too high; I thought game soundtracks were supposed to blend in and keep you focused, not try to trick your heart into beating at 135 BPM? 

The worst part was when I finally found the last character after ALL that work, which was then rewarded with‚Ä¶more work. Actually, more work than I had ever done previously in this game, and if I didn‚Äôt do it, the entire effort of me getting all the other trophies was for naught. That‚Äôs called ‚Äúmoving the goalposts‚Äù and I dont really appreciate that as a gamer who likes to have a concrete goal that I know is achievable (and constant!!). Then you finish this extra homework and your final reward is‚Ä¶. some character I‚Äôve never seen in my life. WOW I‚Äôm so glad I just spent an hour attempting that and I‚Äôm palpitating!! 

Honestly, I enjoyed circularly punching a bunch of flowers and bushes into tiny pieces and running around in them more than I did most of the other gameplay. I truly think the GOTY nomination and win was some sort of inside job. I found this game soulless. Even if I had played every single PlayStation title that has ever come out, like they assume everyone playing this game has, it isn‚Äôt really that interesting or groundbreaking to me to see a silly little recreation of them doing a looped animation.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

That‚Äôs fair. You‚Äôre mad your game didn‚Äôt win GOTY ‚Äúlets go flood the game who did win with bad reviews even though I‚Äôve never played it.‚Äù

Personally, I think it deserved it‚Ä¶& I will tell you why.

I am not a gamer. At all. I play games very minimally‚Ä¶I loved it. My boyfriend and 14yo son couldn‚Äôt be more different than they are in the games they like and play and they BOTH love it. 

3 completely different types of gamers in our house‚Ä¶& we all love it. 

Games do NOT have to be realistic and have an overly complicated story to be a good GAME.

People think that games should be like a movie to be a good game and that is NOT true!

And it is NOT a ‚Äúchild‚Äôs game.‚Äù The game definitely gets too hard for me (like i said, im not a gamer) and I like to think I‚Äôm more skillful and able than a 4 year old, lol. Yeah a 4 year old can play and have fun‚Ä¶but they‚Äôre not going to beat it.

It is an overall really fun game and yes it does have great graphics (when did good graphics become to mean ‚Äúlooks real‚Äù anyways?‚Äù) that EVERYONE could enjoy (if they got that stick out of their butt thinking because it‚Äôs cute means it‚Äôs not a contender or worth trying.) It‚Äôs a FUN game for EVERYONE, and in my opinion, that is GOTY material. 

I wouldn‚Äôt touch Black Myth Wukong with a 10 foot pole and neither would my boyfriend. But it is a my son game. So tell me how a game that 1/3 people in my house loves as opposed a game 3/3 people loves deserved GOTY. 

Sometimes you have to think outside of YOUR BUBBLE. & understand‚Ä¶Astrobot appeals to a much larger group of people and IS an amazing game.  Try it, you‚Äôll love it.

It deserved the win. It‚Äôs what a game should be‚Ä¶.FUN.","You and 1 other person found this helpful.","1 person found this helpful."

Reminded me of Mario 64. I can't imagine many platform games being better than Astro Bot. The soundtrack was brilliant too.

I really enjoyed returning to each world and using the little bot detector bird to find anything I missed the first time around. And the variety of little gadgets is so much fun. Especially the time stop thingy.

I loved this game. 10/10 for pure enjoyment.","You found this helpful.","Was this review helpful to you?"

With so many nods to old-school playstation characters for a little bit of nostalgia.

There is no freaking reason for those levels to be as hard as they are and to have to complete them in order to get the platinum sucks. I feel like I have been ripped off I bought this game digitally for $60 if I had known this game was going to throw this level of hard at me I would of never wasted money on this. To the devs screw you for real and this is supposed to be a kids game ? Yeah right lol. I really want my money back and unfortunately Sony won't give refunds I'm about to call these POS devs and ask them for my money back instead I didn't get what i paid for I want to play a fun game this is not fun. Might as well call it astro bot souls edition. I will never ever buy another digital game of ps store again from now on disc only that way at least I can either return or sell/trade the game in if it sucks like this one does.

It‚Äôs a classic Sony third person adventure platformer. But is it really for the GOTY. Yeah, it won the GOTY, but to be honest, it wasn‚Äôt really the type of game that you would actually call GOTY. 

The story is so plain and straightforward that you, or at least I, really got bored and had to take a break several times because I got sleepy playing it.

Lmfao. You can argue that Nintendo doesn't own the rights to all of the Mario mechanics even though in a lot of cases, Nintendo were the first to come up with the ideas + Nintendo has around 7000 patents for them. And you can also argue that a good game is a good game. Still Sony SHAMELESSY took ideas from pretty much every 3D Mario game ever made (plus a few others like Kirby) and sold the product as Astrobot. It may be a good game but everything it is is thanks to Nintendo.","You and 22 other people found this helpful.","22 people found this helpful."
