"anwar mirza","8 months ago","Interestingly, I find Senua II even better than its predecessor. The graphics are absolutely stunning, often feeling more real than life itself. The visual experience is so captivating that you'll frequently want to stop and admire the beauty of the game's world.

The story of Senua II is relatively short but very engaging, taking about 9-10 hours to complete. Despite its brevity, it's a quality experience that leaves a lasting impression. Each character in the game is memorable, adding depth to the narrative. While the game is quite linear with limited exploration, it's perfect for a weekend playthrough, offering an experience you'll remember long after finishing it.

Ninja Theory has truly outdone themselves with this installment. I was never a diehard Senua fan before, but this game has made me one. I eagerly anticipate what they will bring in the future. The combat in Senua II is unique, simple, and challenging at the same time, making for an enjoyable experience.

Some may perceive Senua II as a ""walking simulator,"" but it's essential to appreciate all the elements it offers. I never understood why this game received criticism at its release; it's a game-of-the-year-worthy title in my eyes. Everyone should try it, as it makes Game Pass even more worth the cost.","19 people found this helpful."
"Zohair Ahmed","8 months ago","**Hellblade: Senua's Saga - A Brief Review**

""Hellblade: Senua's Saga"" is an absolute cinematic masterpiece, offering a rich, immersive experience underscored by high-quality soundtracks. Developed by Ninja Theory, known for their innovative approach to storytelling and game design, the game provides a short but impactful journey, averaging 6-7 hours depending on your play style.

The developers have outdone themselves in crafting a visually stunning world, utilizing the power of Unreal Engine 5 to deliver detailed environments and realistic character models. The sound design is equally impressive, with a soundtrack that enhances the emotional depth of the narrative.

The pace is relatively slow, focusing more on puzzle-solving, walking, story building and cutscenes with occasional combat. While it may not suit the tastes of those who prefer quick-paced hack and slash gameplay like myself, the compelling story kept me thoroughly engaged.

P.S: Those who haven't played the first game needn't worry as there are ample of moments in this game which give you a rundown of what happened earlier

"Kibra Devine","10 months ago","The audio and visuals work together so well to create a masterpiece of storytelling. This game truly takes everything from the first game and brings it up a notch. You can tell they spent a lot of their effort on making sure the player feels immersed in audio and visuals with incredibly seamless transitions between gameplay and cutscenes (that I have never seen done this well).

Senua's psychosis plays a huge role in this game (just like the first) with the return of the conflicting voices in her head that offer aid one minute and doubt the next, adding to Senua's struggle of ups and downs as well as the overall tone of the game.

The combat was similar to the first game but the seemless transitions between killing enemies, the stunning finishers, and the next level audio immersion are really what make the combat special.

They truly took the visual gameplay mechanics to the next level with this one. If you liked Hellblade 1 then you will definitely LOVE this one.","45 people found this helpful."
"Jayesh Sinha","10 months ago","Absolute cinematic experience and a visual showcase of technical prowess gaming industry has achieved! 
Aside from a very short length story, all other things were great.

Puzzles were quite easy but tbf I'd rather have an easy puzzle to solve and move along the story than a difficult one and roaming around looking for cues, that would break me out of the cinematic experience if overused.

Combat was ever so slightly refreshing with different finishers and parry timings varied with different enemies but I kind of have a love hate opinion on the 1 on 1 fight style this time but it does give a more cinematics of an experience.

I needed more of this game although one criticism is that this time around the voices are meaningless even though it's a major part of ""psychosis"" experience but 1st game did it better with varied thoughts and opinions and self doubt.

In this game it was implemented differently more like the voices were trying to state the obvious and hand holding the player

"Sohan Dhanushka Gunarathne","10 months ago","Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is a deep, immersive and emotional journey that transcends your everyday video game. Just like the original, It’s an audiovisual sensory experience that captivates the player simply by its amazing (un)real time graphics, binaural audio, and most importantly through its extremely powerful narrative. 

Although the combat mechanics have simplified to 1v1s, it's way more brutal, calculated and unforgiving compared to the original game. And every combat encounter will definitely keep you at the edge of your seat.

The narrative experience is continuation but expanded upon the original and ultimately teaches you to forgive, make peace with your past and move forward by accepting yourself wholeheartedly. A true masterpiece. 10/10","20 people found this helpful."

As far as the game play and combat, it is PEAK.   Definitely just like the first one combat style but the massive improvement (I didn’t even know it was possible) from the 1st game has me shook.  

I am not done with the game yet as I’m writing this, BUT let me just say I’m already hooked and will play this game more than once!   The story, graphics, voice actors, surrounding sounds, everything and I mean EVERYTHING about this game is a literal masterpiece already!

"Hisham Atieh","9 months ago","A  cinematic masterpiece. This is a very unique game with a story that is told creatively. It is a 9/10 for me.

The visuals are absolutely stunning with Unreal Engine 5 on PC. The music and audio effects are fantastic as well.

With headphones on, I felt that I was in Senua's mind, hearing her thoughts constantly.

Some reviewers mentioned that they hated ""walking too much"".
I somewhat agree with this, especially in puzzles where sprinting is not an option, but it wasn't a big issue for me at all.

Also, others might not like this cinematic way of gameplay but I think that it has a different and unique way of gameplay and fighting than the games we usually know. I LOVED it, the animations and scenes made me feel like a badass Viking in a movie. Besides, I always love games that provide excellent cinematics, which is not for everyone I guess.

A must play !","2 people found this helpful."
"Eric Collard","7 months ago","Born in 1988, Zelda: A Link to the Past has always been my #1 favorite game, with other Zelda's, Final Fantasies, etc. sprinkled in there. But Hellblade 2 has finally dethroned Z:ALTTP.

I do get why most people are turned off from this game, but I feel like they are missing the point... The game(s) are 90% about the psychosis part, the rest is story and gameplay. And as someone with mental issues, having a game like this make me feel noticed, included, and appreciates. Having a woman as the main character is great, too, because the don't often get that. So I'm doubly impressed.

I love these games. The fact that a game developer made such high-quality games about a mental illness blows my mind, and I just can't get over it. I am so emotional about these games, and I feel like anyone who legitimately has any form of psychosis would be appreciative of them. They're true art.","1 person found this helpful."
"Christopher Lopez","9 months ago","Is is an absolute cinematic experience. Visually as great as games look since the PS4 generation, nothing comes close to this in terms of in game photo realism. This is the first game that truly replicates the matrix awakens demo from a few years ago. As for gameplay anyone that played the first game knows this is not a typical game. And some or even many people might be turned off by that but I very much enjoyed how different it is than everything else. No hunting down numerous items, chest, tons of filler side quests, upgrading weapons and armor. While that stuff is obviously fun on many different levels, this game has none of that which is a big positive. You have one sword and when you get to use it in battle it truly is intense. But because it's so different it's hard to recommend it to everyone. I very much enjoyed it and in my opinion it's definitely game of the year material.","3 people found this helpful."
"Nicole G","10 months ago","All the people complaining about a “walking simulator” clearly didn’t play the first game or don’t understand what this game is supposed to be. I think having hellblade 1 as the bar here really hurts- if this was the first installment it wouldn’t have the criticism that it does, because the first game is very hard to surpass. What hellblade 2 DOES do, is take the cinematic experience from the first game and expand upon it. Visuals aside (because no one can disagree that they’re incredible), the combat experience in hellblade 2 is something else. Sure, you’re not fighting 5 dudes in deer masks at once, but every single fight in hellblade 2 feels like this could be the end of your journey. You have random NPCs inserting themselves and breaking up the combo you thought you were about to do, enemies will punch you and disengage to axe somebody else mid-battle. It feels way more “real” compared to the first game- chaotic and heavy and frantic, like a real fight of these sorts would play out. The only reason this game isn’t getting a 10/10 is because it has to live up to the first one, which is near impossible. If you enjoyed the first Hellblade you will definitely enjoy this one, don’t let the negative reviews sway you.","8 people found this helpful."
"Steve L (slad-81)","10 months ago","Holy smokes! This game is next level. Unbelievable single player experience so far. The pacing of this game is much more mature than Hellblade 1. I love the setting and the atmosphere is much darker with Senua not only battling hell but humans too. Part 2 doesn't really go through a tutorial for combat, you have to figure it out on your own, if you haven't played the first part so I highly recommend playing Senua's Sacrifice first. But it's pretty simple to figure out. I could only play this game at 1080p high/medium settings 70fps + for my liking so the game is definitely pushing my rig. You'll need a 3080 card minimum to play at 1440p high. Really dig this new game when I thought single player experience was almost dead. Ninja Theory proved me wrong on that one haha 😅.","20 people found this helpful."
"Kale Laurie","10 months ago","I’m extremely grateful that we finally got a sequel to one of my favorite games of all time, BUT it barely feels like the same game. A major emphasis on adventure replaces the potential for quality combat sequences in favor of fairly mediocre puzzles. Luckily, they aren’t too mind numbing; mainly because they typically utilize the environment containing stunning graphics. Yet they certainly fall short of exceptional entertainment. For a series titled HellBLADE, there is much irony in my sword remaining sheathed. The story is good; however, only dabbles in greatness for brief periods of an already short duration. I’m not overly distraught about a restrained runtime; but when blandness creeps throughout the larger portions of play, it ends up a tad disappointing. Especially when an abundance of cutscenes overtake gameplay for merely alright dialogue. Countless times I couldn’t figure out if a cinematic had hijacked my controls or when it would reinitiate them.

If we get to see Senua again, I really hope Ninja Theory can redeem themselves even if this is a solid entry,","2 people found this helpful."

"Richard Sweeting","9 months ago","The Graphics in this game are the only jem you will leave with. It is a gorgeous and nominally interactive showcase of what UE5 can do and will thusly be used as a showcase going forward. This is not a game people will hold dearly in their hearts for years let alone decades.
This is a one and done experience and for those without clouded vision will want those 5-8 hours back bc once past the initial spectacle, Hellblade 2 is a bare bones experience that borrows from its predecessor  in some ways, back tracks in others and genuinely screws up what the original title stood for by going overboard on elements that should be subtle.
The story has little weight and the diologue no real meaning. Leaving a sensible player with no connection  to the protagonist and the characters you meet.
The combat is literally cut n paste and has little meaning to each swipe whether heavy or light its just a numbers game. Couple that with Enemies that may look different but are very much the same encounter each time, and your left with a lot of repetition.
75% of this game is spent walking with no environmental interaction or things to find. It's text book beautiful emptiness. I can't  reccomend to be honest. It's just one of those games you show off with only they are usually good all around. Other games like this have just done a much better job like The Order 1886.

"Owen Blake","10 months ago","First of all I want to refute a lot of the big headlines saying that this game is 4-5 hours long. This is false if you are actually playing and engaging in the story. It would take you 4-5 hours if you just held down sprint through everything, skipped story beats, collectables and played on easy. I spent roughly 10-11 hours to complete the game's main story with a total completion of roughly 70%. Don't just read the headlines. 

I played the first Hellblade and this one was far more challenging in combat despite only taking on one enemy at a time. With combat sequences being 1v1s they were more curated and extremely fluid and cinematic. The animations are perfect and very satisfying. 

The graphics speak for themselves. Anybody with eyes can see that this game doesn't lack in that department. 

As for bugs... Well there were absolutely none throughout my entire play through. It's an amazing technical achievement to have a game of this quality so polished. Also I want to add this games loading is bare to none with the only loading screen being when you load up your save and the entirety of the game doesn't have a single loading screen. I also have to say the music is great. At point I questioned if Hanz Zimmer had helped make some tracks.

This is my personal GOTY and I'd give it a very solid 9/10. Only criticisms are that I'd like there to be a little more combat or the combat sequences to last a little longer like a couple enemies or maybe fighting one or two enemies with one of the other characters together to mix it up, but I'd feel that be a bit nitpicky. Maybe the puzzles could be a little more complicated like the first game. 

It's a must play, especially if you have game pass. If you're not a fan that's okay it's not for you. It hasn't well connected well with many people as it's a very story driven game. However, I'd argue they simply just don't appreciate the story aspect of the game.","5 people found this helpful."

Did notice the removal of the block break, not completed it yet so may return just seems odd to remove it after it being so heavily used in the first one but the fighting has increased in complexity which I love as by the end of the first game I was on the highest difficulty and just found the fights too easy so I am glad they improved that area. I have been waiting for the game since I seen the first trailer in 2020 but after playing it I'm happy with the wait because its the first game of the year I've played that's came out with no bugs (so far) which has to be the rarest thing in modern gaming.

"Paul K","10 months ago","I've just completed Hellblade II and to be honest there is a little bit of disappointment. Ever since playing the first game I have eagerly been waiting for a 2nd instalment, I don't think I've ever been so excited about a new game coming out. My disappointment lies in that after waiting so long, it's over so quickly, it's almost over before it even begins.

Having said that......it's one of the best games I ever experienced, I'd call it an experience rather than playing a game. The level of detail is just incredible, I found myself looking down at the ripples in puddles and small stones on the ground in awe! It's like nothing I've ever seen before in a game. 
The combat is tricky, but not hard, you do feel that Senua is scraping through these fights, which are brutal in their nature. Full admiration for Melina for learning combat moves like that!
The sound is amazing too, headphones are a must, don't even bother without them, you won't get the full experience. The sound of the rain, walking on gravel, the waves, it's all so authentic.

If you play games for the explosions, action and kill count, this won't be for you. It's a work of art, a masterpiece that needs to be appreciated for the incredible amount of research and work that has gone into it. I'd recommend watching the development videos on YouTube to see the effort that went into making it. 
The trauma Senua experiences is terrifying and really opens your eyes to the affliction real people live with daily.

Ninja Theory are a one of a kind developer, nobody else would have had the passion and dedication to pull this off. Thank you for the experience.","5 people found this helpful."
"Matthew Heinrich","10 months ago","Pretty good game. I don’t like how the game is always in “cinematic” mode where my screen is forced to display in a wide perspective. This cuts my screen vision in the game by a third which is crazy because the environment is amazing to look at. Wish there was an option to have the game display on the entire screen. 

There’s also some minor level design decisions that I have found off-putting so far though. 

*Minor Spoilers Ahead*
Like in the beginning, there’s a crashed boat on the shore you have to climb under. There’s this whole sequence of the main character climbing through the boat wreckage so she could reach the other side. When I emerged out of the boat, I look to the left and see this small pile of rocks that the main character could easily climb over, however, there’s an invisible wall blocking the her from taking this more reasonable route to get around the boat. 

Level design decisions like this makes me think the main character is a self-inflicted masochist. She secretly doesn’t want to live anymore so she purposely takes the most difficult routes possible to reach her destinations. If this was the character quality the writers were going for, then I say bravo.","15 people found this helpful."
"Azwan Nazreensyah","10 months ago","I had an awesome time playing such a cinematic game. The unreal engine 5 graphic is jaw dropping. 
Yep, there's walking quite a lot, but having them visuals and sound through your headphones are immersive enough that i quite enjoyed those long walks at times. 
Although the story is quite short and the battle mechanics arent as deep as other typical modern games, it is a breath of fresh air to have that simple and straightforward combat. 
It's simple, yet it is making you at the edge of the seat at times as you have to really manage your timing. As real as it gets. 
This game doesn't deserve the hate of other fanboys, they're unfounded. Be open and you will have a good time. As a neutral, i can easily suggest this game.

"Bradford Hordijk","10 months ago","It’s not so much a game as an audio-visual work of art. If you are expecting the former you’ll hate it but if you are fine with the latter you’re set. 

It is a worthy continuation of Senua’s story. No, it doesn’t play that much different and yes it has the same sort of puzzles although the Huldafolk level does it so well it feels refreshing.

Combat is more visceral and brutal and feels more serious this time. The first game had some combat scenes that were way too long and far too easy to get through.

I love seeing Senua’s further growth and the supporting cast is just great. The only question remains; are they real, figments of her imagination or superimposed thoughts on actual people?

So yes it is a continuation of the first one in many ways and its innovative in small but important ways. It seems to flow better than its predecessor and nowhere was I bored and felt I was just doing endless combat or endless puzzles.

I loved the first one, and this one was just as good. It’s MEANT to be a painful and grueling journey. You’re literally playing as a character that suffers from a tremendous mental affliction. Yes, a couple of the puzzles were a little annoying, but not difficult. But other than that, the combat felt nice, the game is an absolute visual stunner, especially if you enter photo mode. And there’s two more modes unlocked after you beat the game. One of those modes just features different narratives from other people as you play through, and I haven’t beaten it the second time yet, but even if the third locked mode gives you a narrative from the side of the darkness, then that pretty cool. Especially considering that the entire idea of the game is a battle with reality and perspective.

Story, stunning. Interesting, twisting and very well written. Looking forward to finishing it here shortly. 

I think combat feels good, heavier and more impactful. But it's harder to fight across the board with the timing being hard to master. To be fair they did say that everything is intended to make you feel like Senua is just ""surviving"" and that goal was definitely met in my opinion.

Good points:
* Amazing graphics 
* Music is excellent 
* Quite scary in places, psychological horror

Bad points:
* Large parts of the game are just walking in slow motion while dialogue plays. Either walking or climbing or crawling through narrow caves and you do it really slowly too.
* Puzzles are repetitive and simple 
* Only 7 hours long.

Gave it a 5 / 10 because although large parts are extremely boring - mainly walking from cutscene to cutscene, there is a brilliance about it. The excellent graphics certainly helps and the music adds to the moods well.

I should note that I only realised you can roll while fighting to avoid certain attacks 3/4's of the way through the game due to there being zero on screen display or tutorials.","5 people found this helpful."
"Kurt Zelasko","10 months ago","I’ve seen a lot of people express their disappointment in this game, and it paints this picture that people don’t really know what a video game is. 

A video game is an interactive digital media used as a form of entertainment. The first we get ahead in technology, the more we are able to tell a more polished and nuanced story. 

Hellblade 2 is an incredible example of this, foregoing a ton of “gameplay” as to put you behind the steering wheel of a narrative that really, plays itself. This game has a photo mode available at the press of a button, and every single inch of this game has plenty of opportunity you to take advantage of it. 

If you’re expecting a ton of combat, crazy boss fights… this game WILL disappoint you. But if you accept this game for what it is, rather than what you wanted  - a sensory filled, narrative driven experience- then you will absolutely love this beauty of a piece of media.

It’s out on gamepass, which is 20 dollars a month. You’ll beat it in a day or two, and you’ll go “man, that was something.”

Everything from the acting to the soundtrack is on another level. The gameplay is very slight and I would of preferred more protracted, more frequent battles but as I said, it's an experience. More akin to a movie than a video game.

The battles are close, with four moves on offer, dodge, block, light attack, heavy attack., and the moves all feel grounded and weighty. You feel every block and strike. That being said the animations, although fluid and lifelike, are repeated and it's obvious to spot which detracts from the immersion. It's not open world and there are no choices to be made, which i would of loved as the story seems like there are choices but there's none, on rails with only one path to go.

The story is okay but doesn't even remotely seem to connect to the first what so ever and the parts that do are so jumbled and scattered throughout to try to add some sort of connection. Forced walking and drawn out cinematics, like unnecessarily long crawling through holes and squeezing through cracks or staring at the scenery for longer than necessary. Just an all around ridiculous amount of filler. Not to mention the copy and paste puzzles with a different look but the exact same layout. Newer enemies yet smaller one on one fights and as long as you dodge and land shots can kill most enemies in 5 hits. Really haven't been this disappointed for a drawn out game release since KOH4.

"Tony Silva","8 months ago","I just finished the game, and I truly loved the first one because I'm crazy about ancient peoples, ancient religions, Nordic paganism, Celtic people, and all that. I was truly expecting to play this game.

So, the first things, which are things I don't care much about, are graphics and gameplay. That's a 10/10 for the graphics; the quality of the graphics is insane. They are better than the first one, which was already amazing. Now, the gameplay doesn't change much, but it is enjoyable. I like the combat system, but I hated the puzzles since the first one. The gameplay can get, and probably will get, repetitive. That's a 5/10.

The soundtrack is cool, could have been better. They had this amazing band called Heilung doing the songs, and if you know Heilung, you know what they can do. It's a 7/10, could have been 10.

Actors: The actress who plays Senua is incredible, that's a 10/10 too. And all the others did well too.

Now, what I do care about when I play games is the story, and that's a personal thing for me. If you hate games that feel more like movies, this isn't for you. And maybe I would have enjoyed it more if the writing was better. I loved the story of the first game, and it's a whole saga about Senua, about her sacrifice, her life, etc., and it's beautifully done. Now, on this one, I didn't feel truly connected to the story. It wasn't personal enough, I guess, and I couldn't find myself truly connected to the characters in the story, like we all did with Senua in the first game. This just didn't click; I didn't like the story or the way they took it.

What I liked was the emphasis on the Norsemen, brutal as they were, and I would love if they got more into that, more human things.

But overall, and it makes me sad to say this, but I think they only made this game because they felt like it needed to be made or something, I don't know. Because the first one had a whole lot more soul, without being with Microsoft or having that much of a budget. If they had no better story to continue, maybe they just shouldn't have continued.

Overall, feels just an unnecessary sequence, empty characters, an empty story.

I feel sad because I truly loved the first one, but I couldn't get myself to connect with the story of this one.

So, it's a 3/5.","2 people found this helpful."
"Z Botz","10 months ago","Just finished this grueling masterpiece last night. Graphics 10. Gameplay 4, due to a lot of walking! Audio 10, freaking scary voices that still remain in my head! Puzzles 7, not too hard. Battle Physics 7. Where this is not close to ACVH or Ghosts of Tsushima, limited controls and weapons. Just after beating the game I immediately went back to an early chapter to fight the Druids! Overall 7. Where this game lacks in gameplay, the graphics, visuals and audio make up for it! It is terrifyingly gruesome! This was a bit f a grind, couldn’t stop playing because I wanted to battle more demons! Definitely not meant for children! You will fall in love with Senua and if you survive or not you will want MORE out of this game!!!","1 person found this helpful."
"Ben Robinson","5 months ago","Hellblade 2 picks up brilliantly after the first title, with a recap of the original story for those who haven't played it, and if you have then you'll find this game much the same. There are the graphic and gameplay improvements that you'd expect with next gen sequel but otherwise this game doesn't offer much that's new. It seems that the mold wasn't broken when Senua's Sacrifice was released but it definately couldn't be bettered either. The original grabbed me from beginning to end but I have found myself getting bored at times playing this one, it's as dark and as emersive but this really is why I got bored - I felt that I'd played it already. 
If you didn't play the original then get on your own in a dark room and you'll love this, but if you did play the original don't expect anything more than what you've already done.","Was this review helpful to you?"

This game gets a PERFECT SCORE!!! If you are wondering about the people who gave this game a 1 star review here is something you might find interesting. My friend who owns a PS5 gave it a 1 star. But the interesting thing is that he wanted to play the game every time he came over since it came out. He said he loves it, so when I asked him why he gave it a 1 star review his answer was. "" I'm a PlayStation guy, and since it's not coming out on the PS5 I gave it a 1"". He then said all PS5 fanboys give every Xbox  Series X game a 1 if the game does not come out on PS5.

"Christian Huye","9 months ago","1/5 stars if u actually payed full price for this game. 2/5 if u got it free on Game Pass. Everybody giving this game a 5/5 claiming it’s the best graphics in gaming are brain dead when it’s a 6-8 hour walk and talk game with easier puzzles than I played in Zelda games on Nintendo. Only things worth mentioning are graphics and the “Binaural audio” which again it’s a 7 hour walking game with combat that’s honestly so easy it’s criminal any enemy can be beat by Parrying 3 times and there’s no differences in the enemy mechanics just how they look. If anybody gives this $50 5 hour game a 5/5 they’re lying to promote buying this garbage walking simulator to either help the studio or help Microsoft. The story is eh no characters that are interesting or awesome but it tells a somewhat interesting story. Can’t believe some people got tricked into buying this mid. If they say 5/5 I’m convinced they never played a 5/5 game and that’s facts.","10 people found this helpful."
"Billy","3 days ago","First one was my absolute favourite game, this one is basically an unreal engine cutscene, hold forward and hammer the A button to play through except she can't step over a pebble and there's no indication of where to go so even getting past the first level is as frustrating as it gets. Graphics are cranked up so much that an albeit older graphics card which can still play most modern games struggles on the lowest setting.... proper gutting, about the only scottish video game character in existance (although she has a London accent for some unholy reason) with an interesting premise turned into ""look at how good our graphics are"".

Only issue I currently have is that the graphics are meh in a sense that the upscalers kinda hold it back on PC. I will definitely download on the series x to see what 4k offers. But I prefer my 80 to 90 fps. But it should be a full blown cinematic experience. Aka full resolution needed. @xbox you should have given this game more attention. Because of your choices lately this game will carry most of the generation this year. Solid game at the end of the day. I just also feel Xbox pushed this game out the door just a little, not a lot out the door. Highly recommend this game and the team behind it.

"Vaniel Smegan","9 months ago","Loved the first game and was really looking forward to this. Sadly, it's a linear walking sim with repetitive, simple puzzles, non existent combat and gameplay (it's literally walk, talk, cinematic, repeat) and a gorgeous but sterile and restrictive environment you can't explore or interact with.

Half of the dialogue is pretentious non sense and the overall story is maybe 2-3 hrs that is padded and slowed down to make it last 5-6 hrs. The constant ""chatter"" in Senuas head gets pretty annoying, adds little to her character, and becomes a distraction when trying to listen to the general conversations. Use it tastefully to provide perspective, depth and highlight inner turmoil. Not every. Single. Sentence.

All it has going for it are the graphics and audio. Feels more like an art project or a demo for the Unreal Engine than a game. Glad it's on Xbox Game pass - would have sucked to pay full price for it.","4 people found this helpful."

"Ralph England","10 months ago","Graphics are amazing.

Gameplay is awful.  The combat in the first was simple, but elegant and surprisingly skillful. In the sequel it's awkward and artificial. Your move set is smaller, strategy very limited. Enemies face you 1v1 despite times when Senua is surrounded. 

The story in the first was great- touching, relatable,  well acted. You were never sure of what was real or not. In the sequel the supernatural is confirmed to exist, making the psychosis Senua suffers from a gimmick- a cheap set of voiced in your ear- rather than a driving force behind the action and gameplay.

And you're forced to walk so often. You can HOLD the SPRINT button to walk slightly faster. The 5 hour run time could easily have been 4 just by letting you run more often.

Don't buy. Play on gamepass if you have it. If you don't have game pass you're not missing much.","11 people found this helpful."
"Erik Lunde","9 months ago","After a rather miserable start, both thematically and mechanically, the game finds its voice(s) many steps later, when a poignant tale of psychological freedom emerges. In the first game, Senua confronts and overcomes the demons in herself, and now this game pivots to her helping others to do the same. The ending blew me away in terms of how deep the characters and their experiences go. I will never forget the line ""you must show them a different way"" in the context of dealing with psychosis, breaking free from a brutally dark past, and turning away from the path your ancestors carved for you. While I wish this had been the focus from the start in this game, the final two chapters displayed a mastery of scripting, A/V direction, and game design I won't soon forget.","Was this review helpful to you?"

Dumb
Uninspiring
Lack of creativity 
Copy and paste
Boring walking simulator
Poor story
Too much talking 😡

I see some clowns saying ""if you like the first game you're gonna like this as well"". No, I love the first hellblade and I hate this garbage. 5 star reviews from blind idiots that knows nothing but pretty graphics and visuals.

Hellblade 1 has a soul. It felt pretty original and authentic, quality binary sounds, great story, 2 enemies at a time and clean combat.

 I thought HB2 was really going to improve from the first one, come out strong as a rivalry with sony's god of war but failed big time. What is this? God of war succeeded because of the gameplay, the last of us 2 succeeded because of the gameplay even though some folks don't like the story but they still find the gameplay fun. 

Ninja theory; I want to play a game, I want to play gameplay not empty and boring good looking graphics and visuals. This is really bad. 99 percent walking, 1 percent combat. Lazy ass developers spent 7 years developing pretty graphics. 

Glad I got it for free. Don't waste ur money on this crap, just watch the game on YouTube. Believe the 1 star reviews. If you want to play hellblade just play the first one. I don't know what this is. 🤦‍♂️","1 person found this helpful."
"Eric Wells","10 months ago","Some of these reviews are hilarious. I read one that said this game is super immersive. Just wow. This game is far from immersive. It's basically a really good movie. A pretty gnarly movie. There's not much gameplay other than walking around. The combat looks super cool, but is very basic due to there being only 4 buttons you need to push (parry, dodge, attack, and heavy attack). There's no skill tree, no weapons upgrade, or character building. You're basically walking through a super gnarly movie with the occasional puzzle and occasional combat. This could have been a great game, a masterpiece. However, they decided to make a movie instead. I'd recommend playing it if you have game pass and you're in a chill mood looking for a good movie to watch. I'd be upset if I spent money on this game though.","1 person found this helpful."

There is many things that they changed compared to the first one. In the first Hellblade, if you died to many times, you had to restart the entire game (I completed it my first playthough). It made the game way more intense and I loved it. It was way more challenging fighting multiple opponents at once. The bosses in the first one were incredible as well, but this game didn't have any boss fights with special moves and the combat was very easy. It was like playing through a 6 hour movie. I still enjoyed the game alot even though it was short. I recommend playing the game even though it doesn't come close to the greatness of the first game.

At least with God of War I got to play the game after a long cutscene. This game... it's basically playing The Order only with less action. Sure, it's sort of cerebral, but this was done in the first game. Was hoping for something new and fresh, like a take on a female viking version of God of War, but no. Super linear, on rails walking simulator with frequent cutscenes to show off where all the money went: facial animations. It sure wasn't spent on gameplay or other graphics.

All the same photo scanned stone corridors are primitive and tasteless.

The plot is primitive too and it is more like you get a Spanish shame feeling. It is a pure cringe. Uneducated and intellectually empty modern people that know nothing about todays reality about what is going on people that know nothing about our history pretend they can teach you something. What a shame. Even recently released Indika is more game while it has cool locations, awesome style and even some stupid but fun moments. The cheap indie game that cost pennies and has its own problems is more like a game that should have been developed by NT while what we've got from NT in fact is a downgrade of their first game.","7 people found this helpful."
"raider wrong","4 months ago","After playing the original, I was really looking forward to the sequel. And I'm happy to say it was worth the wait, for the most part.
My gripe with the game is combat. Sadly I feel it's not up to par with original. I found combat to be repetitive and with no way to level up throughout the game it becomes stale by the end.
However the game is more like a piece of art, and having said that I can see why combat is the way it is.
So onto the positives, graphically the game is amazing, I think it's the best I've seen in the latest console generation, I often find myself pausing to take in the view. The lighting is beautiful as well as the weather effects, I really was taken away with how well they've done. The sound is also masterful, playing with a headset is a must!

"Deana Anne","8 months ago","It was at best, okay. I loved the first game and was really excited for the second. The second wasn't nearly as good as thr first.

What I liked: it's a great atmosphere. It's creepy and beautiful at the same time. The actors did a fantastic job and you can tell they gave it their all. The graphics are also beautiful. 

What I didn't like: most of the game you are just walking or watching a cut scene. Like 80% of the game is just cut scenes and walking without really doing anything. I even found the combat frustrating because it's constantly switching between cut scene and combat. When you are actually playing the game it's just some simple puzzles or repetitive combat. For a full $70 cad game, it was really short. Like 7 hours.

In short, it felt like a step back from the first game. If you want a walking simulator through a creepy and interesting world, then you'd love it.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Mike","8 months ago","After playing the original Hellblade, I was eagerly awaiting the release of this sequel. The graphics are absolutely stunning and the fact that its running in real time is a technological feat Ninja Theory should be proud of. The sound design is also exceptional and this game MUST be played with headphones to get the full experience of Senua’s thought process. 

Unfortunately I found it hard to really engage with the story as there are definitely pacing issues with the game. At some points, I was so disengaged with the story that I had to take a break from the game. The level design had many long sections of walking, which made going from one event to another rather painful. There were several points in the game where I could see how far I had to walk and let out a big sigh. I also found I was constantly holding the run button as Senua’s movements are way too slow. Her jogging speed should’ve been her walking speed. They really need to have an ‘always run’ option in the game. 

Speaking of events (puzzles and combat), they were few and far between. The combat is a major downgrade from the first game. I can see what Ninja Theory was trying to do with the combat to make it cinematic, but it ends up being extremely repetitive, linear and stale after a few encounters. The puzzles were simplistic and the fact that, again, a lot of walking is involved, made some of them rather painful. 

Ultimately, this game was a disappointment and serves as a good example that graphics mean nothing if gameplay isn’t up to scratch.","1 person found this helpful."

The fighting is sparse and when it is there very clunky and awkward. The final nail in the coffin is the total lack of shock and horror that was a total rush and left you wanting to see what happens next.

It's painfully slow, combat mechanics are mud, and the gameplay overall was so unbalanced. No flow, whatsoever.

It feels like they wanted to make a longer game but instead of thinking of tasks or an adventure, they just made everything you do like trudging through mud. This makes the voices triggering - whereas before they were an insight and experience into mental illness - now it feels like the game is trying to incite mental illness.

Its constantly talking to you with no hope of really making sense.  The 3 voices that talk non stop contradict themselves constantly.  Nobody really knows why you are there.  You go find these hidden people and basically they supposedly help you and reward you with a waterfall scene.  Not sure how that was a reward.  Its got its charm, i only kept playing because I thought it would eventually reveal itself to be a cohesive story.  It never really did.  You may like games of complete nonsense and thats fine. Wasn’t really all that fun.  Did I mention you get to walk a lot?   It might be difficult to have a conversation with the people who came up with this story.  They probably need some counseling.","8 people found this helpful."

The soundtrack to hell blade 2 is beyond the bar. It’s some of the most moving honest and philosophical insights that one could grasp from just sound alone.","Was this review helpful to you?"

"Carol Thompson","5 months ago","I just don't feel it. Don't get me wrong it's a beautiful game. The first one was a masterpiece that truly made you feel immersed in the madness and the darkness. In this one they took the rot away, so your sense of urgency not to die is taken away. While the first one was way too heavy on puzzles it still had something that this one is just missing.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Jeremy Carlson","9 months ago","I'm sorry, I have too (respectfully) disagree with the other reviews.  Gameplay, audio and visuals of Hellblade 2 are top notch.  No argument there.

The problem I have is that this is literally Hellblade 1.5.  Zero effort was put in by the developer to excite the player into this game.  Absolutely no new game mechanics, tactics or abilities were added.  Combat is exactly the same.

Hellblade 2:  Walk around finding lame collectibles, listen to Senuas voices, watch cutscene and every now and then you have some (which quickly became boring also) combat.  Save yourself the purchase price.

I loved Hellblade Senuas Sacrifice.  But after playing  hellblade 2, I'm sorry.  I lost all respect for the title.  Ninja Theory, put in some effort.  We all don't play Minecraft or the Sims.","3 people found this helpful."

The game was beautiful to look at which is good because thats literally all you do is look at it. The cutscenes are not able to be skipped and you have to watch everything. Felt forced with no gamers enjoyment or creativity. The voices in her head as you walk drove me nuts. The graphics would be more enjoyable with free roam capabilities. Instead of giving us a game to play what we have here is a movie with analog sticks.
   Just make it a movie and be done with it.","4 people found this helpful."

There is virtually no gameplay aside from walking, and you can't even really die.

The game developers missed a perfectly good ending point and after that point, you just can't wait for the game to end.  Would have been a five-star game if the developers had ended it when it felt like the end of the story.

After finding it stupidly challenging, meaningless and boring, I find that it has no purpose. I keep playing because I were hoping it to get better but no. 
For a grungy game like this I was looking forward to a thrill. Instead I'm doing empty tasks that serve no intellectual calcubility. I'm walking around aimlessly hoping to bump into the right direction.
