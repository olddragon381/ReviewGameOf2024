"Ruben Galindo","a year ago","I honestly came into this title without high expectations, I‚Äôve played all the assasins creed side scrollers and was underwhelmed by each entry, But this..This game is something completely different.
You can tell right off the bat when you start that love and care for the property was put into this and it‚Äôs not just a simple cash grab based on name sake alone, The combat is fast and fluid with the prince acrobatic moves very much in effect just in a 2D playing field. You don‚Äôt start super weak and slow and have to work your way up, You start decent with some knowledge and experience under your belt, And through this HUGE open metroidvania world you discover many Secrets, Trinkets, Add ons (power ups), and so forth. The story is a simple one, I won‚Äôt do any spoilers but it‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs a bit more eloquent then save the princess but not by much more, The meat of the game here lies in the gameplay department. 
The graphics are nothing crazy, Early ps4 era visuals on the characters themselves along with terrible lip synching, But the beautiful and lush environments that you traverse along the way, The playing field is really REALLY big. It‚Äôs not overly complicated unless you want to find all the secrets and so forth, And all the challenge that prince of Persia brings with platforming, jumps, pole swinging..it‚Äôs ALL still here and it works so much better than you think in 2D. Honestly this game is a love letter to fans and deserves nothing by the highest praise especially coming from a publisher which rarely takes risks and usually plays it on the safe side with their titles. If you‚Äôre on the fence about it, TRUST me this is 100% worth the asking price of $50. Deluxe edition are cosmetics and 1 power up that is cool but nothing to write home about, The standard version is just fine. If it weren‚Äôt for the dated graphics and weird voice/facial animations this would be a 10, As a critic I have to knock it down a point in that department..But apart from cosmetically flawed EVERYTHING else is brimming with life and deserves nothing but the highest praise, Bravo team, Bravo. 9 out of 10 - Magnificent-","129 people found this helpful."
"Erfan Abolghasemi","a year ago","As a Persian who knows the mythology of my homeland, Prince of Persia The Lost Crown is simply Incredible. This is probably the closest work to the actual Persian mythology in all of entertainment. Some of the characters' names are the names of my family members, Mount Qaf, the game's main location, was one of the night stories of my childhood (pretty much every Persian knows what Mount Qaf is), all the symbols, reliefs, ancient texts etc. are worked so accurately with Persepolis, Behistun and Persian cuneiform that it feels like a Iranian dev has made this game. I'm saying all of this just to confirm one thing: Ubisoft has absolutely NAILED the Persian mythology here. They nailed it so perfectly to a point where I feel like maybe the development team have actually traveled to Iran for research and no one knows about it lol. Even the names of all the objects you find or purchase are all fully based on mythological and sometimes even historical characters and locations. - Another thing that Ubisoft has done very authentically is the music. The trailers didn't really do justice to the actual music, but its a completely different story with the game itself. Iranian instruments are so regularly been used in the pieces that I recognize them immediately every time they are played. Its so beautiful and so Persian-based that it made me to stop moving forward and just listen to the music a couple of times. Santur, Tar, Setar and Tombak are some of the instruments used in the music, all Persian, and all perfectly used (Shout out to Gareth Coker & Mentrix!). - And... the Persian language support. This is a BIG deal for a lot of people, and it would have been a huge disappointment if it wasn't good, well, I'm happy to tell y'all that the Persian voice acting has been done absolutely flawlessly. Their expressions are amazing and their voices fit the characters very well. Here's a exclusive for ya'll: The dubbing has been done by MJKB Studio (Moje Ketab), and I know some of them actually, they've worked on dubbing countless movies, TV shows and animations in the country, which indicates that Ubisoft has went directly to the original source for the Persian language. The dubbing manager said in a interview recently that more companies are working with them to have Persian language in their games aswell, so more is coming. This is a first time happening for Persian language, and trust me, its a big deal.

"Grace Knight","7 months ago","Fun, but has major issues that ruin it.

The game has a good story and nice boss fights, but there are multiple aspects of this game that just totally ruin it for me. Warning I yap a lot!

SAVING: It might seem insignificant, but be wary if you don‚Äôt have several hours to spend playing the game at a time. You can only manually save at the Wak-Wak trees, and autosave only happens after ‚Äòmajor‚Äô events. I‚Äôve had to lose progress multiple times because i‚Äôm unable to get back to a Wak-Wak tree. The Wak-Waks are also spaced weird to where sometimes if you die you have to walk through over half the area again just to get back to where you were.

PAR CORE: I enjoy par core in games‚Ä¶ to an extent. I‚Äôm not talking about the leaf puzzles in the forrest or the bell puzzles, but rather the hall-dashing ones. Why in the world would you cover entire pathway tunnels in reset material, I have no idea. It makes getting through one small section incredibly annoying and difficult. This is ESPECIALLY excessive in The Pit of Eternal Sands. It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if it were only a jump or two, but to have such a long stretch of it is exhausting. Not only that, but when you die it takes you to the last solid ground you were on, meaning your respawn point could be AGES away, and you have to do it all over. It just adds unnecessary difficulty.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS: These are also fine and a fun challenge to dodge to an extent. My issue comes when they‚Äôre placed excessively. An example is in the ocean area where many of the platforms need to have timed jumps before you get zapped ON TOP of enemies already being present. The par core is hard enough without being damaged every 2 seconds (not to mention the damage often cancels a jump, ruining it). It‚Äôs better to pick ONE challenge for players to focus on‚Äîmaybe two‚Äîbut any more and it becomes infuriating. That jumping puzzle to get out of the Azhdaha area for instance. Why put par core, constantly falling platforms, AND projectiles all at once? The amulet can help a little, but not enough for it to stop being a major issue.

ANIMATION/RESPONSE TIME: Since the more advanced fights are well done, this is less of a problem but still a gripe for normal enemies. When fighting, you have to wait for Sargon‚Äôs animation to finish before doing anything else. While this isn‚Äôt a new concept, his animations can take unnecessarily long depending on your combo. This leads to difficulty dodging and can be the difference between victory and defeat. 

Overall i‚Äôm disappointed because this game has a great story, and with it a lot of potential. Unfortunately the items listed above really ruin the game for me and make it unenjoyable to play. There‚Äôs a lot I didn‚Äôt cover (ie. how ridiculous getting Xerxes coins are, long status effects, enemy bombing, etc)  but I listed the main issues I have. They‚Äôre so bad that I wonder how much player testing they actually did before releasing. I‚Äôm not sure whether i‚Äôm going to continue the game or not, but if any of the above would pose a serious issue for you then i‚Äôm glad I could help!","22 people found this helpful."
"Zayd Zeitawi","2 months ago","The Lost Crown is an incredible experience that truly stands out. The fluid combat system and the ability to mix up combos with various skills made every battle feel dynamic and exciting. The massive map and exploration kept me hooked for hours, with parkour mechanics adding a fun and satisfying layer to traversal.

The boss fights, in particular, stood out extremely well. Each one felt unique and challenging, adding an extra layer of excitement and tension to the game. The challenges and puzzles were enjoyable and well-designed, offering a good mix of difficulty and creativity. Some areas, though, felt slightly empty due to a lack of enemies, but it wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker.

What really blew me away was the art style‚Äîmany rooms and environments were so beautifully crafted that I had to stop and take it all in. Overall, this is a game that delivers on so many levels. A solid 9/10 for me! Highly recommended game! üëèüèº","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Micha≈Ç Backwater","a year ago","It's a good AA game. Nothing really great, outstanding. On normal difficulty fights are rather not too hard, in my first 5 hours I've died 10-15 times and most of those on bosses but I'm not very experienced in side scrolling games or in platformers or brawlers - only Hollow Knight finished a few years ago. 

Map isn't very dense, in Hollow Knight player was small and paths could be very narrow. Here everything is big, we can jump really high so every next platform is far away, there're many parts of the map that are simply empty space, every location with this respawn tree is empty or almost empty (no monsters, maybe some platforms and in one place lots of NPCs). There's also not many monsters types and numbers, I've seen already most things in 4 of 10 locations in the game and I don't think I've defeated over 100 opponents. But yeah, it's so easy to avoid opponents or just jump around them that it's player choice to fight.

Art is nice, story and cutscenes are actually worth watching/following because not everything is told in a straight-forward way, game is working well on KB + M - just shift makes problems if I hit it too often but I didn't even care about changing keybindings, I don't really expect any problems in this game or frustration.

Platforming is harder for newbies but after a few hours I have almost no problems with more difficult obstacles and there's a lot of useful skills to speed up exploration. I remember Hollow Knight as more difficult but I'm not sure. And actually each failure doesn't cost us much - maybe half of one healthbar, maybe less and even in first half of the game I have like 4 healthbars, 2 potions which heal me fully and a skill (which is available after hitting and blocking opponents) that also heals me fully. This game isn't brutal.

Overally I recommend this game to any player who just wants a medium level challenge, maybe even to total beginners in such games (everything is nicely introduced) and even to kids - I don't know what age restriction has this game but it looks perfect for not experienced teenagers. It's not a diamond for me but I waited for this game and it's not disappointing either. Worth the price but I wouldn't compare it to HK.","15 people found this helpful."
"Oliver M","8 months ago","Few games have given me the wonder and excitement like The Lost Crown. Each biome is full of enchantment, beautiful landscapes, unique enemies, treasures, platforming challenges, puzzling and sometimes a highly memorable boss fight. 

I was the first generation of platforming videogames and to this day the nostalgia and simplicity is like a magnet for me. TLC oddly hasn't had a huge splash on the market (yet) but has been well recepted and received the praise it's worth. Like Ori, Hollow Knight and Guacamelee before it, TLC is crowned best metroidvania of 24', best UBI game in the last decade, GOTY contender for me and others alike and refreshes a long forgotten series in a near perfect release. 

I hope this game goes viral in the community as the word continues to spread, for my own selfishness of wanting more and the altruistic motive of others to find the awe inspiring moments I have with this masterpiece. The Rayman team knew platformers before and have evolved to being one of the best in the industry and genre. Well done!","1 person found this helpful."
"Sean Hassan","a year ago","This games incredible because it mixes the old school with the new school and you have so many abilities it makes the gameplay loads of fun . A lot of hours you could pour into the game over the course of time itself.  Story wise was interesting combat wise it was fun as hell . It still is what do I mean was.  It always will be.  Puzzles , platforming,  combat  all mixed into one game. Platforming for the first half of the game will seem like a minor task in those hard to reach areas.  He gets more abilities as the story progresses . So you eventually have all these cool and fun abilities to use which make the gameplay so much fun.  Ranged weapons about 4 of them 
Melee close range weapons just 2 main ones . It's so good it Is one of those games where it manages to embrace you so close that I not once needed YouTube for assistance.  Like a lot of games tend to do . This game makes the challenge just enough for u to figure it out and not frustrate u to the point of wanting to end the game then and there.  Few challenging spots like few boss fights and few platforming spots . That's where the games main challenges come from those harder boss fights , some puzzles that youll be stuck on for little till u will figure it out.  The puzzles are just enough puzzles for me.  If it kept going on with those puzzles I would have had a different outlook of the game . It some how blends all areas of game play combat,  puzzles,  platforming all into one and make it pretty much a perfect game. This game so far has my vote for game of the year for 2024 . Sure it's way to early to call it yet it's got the vibes about it where it's gonna be hard to compete with granted it's so fun graphically is impressive. For a 2.5 D game yet I really thought prior to its release when I seen it last year figured it was gona be a hit or miss kinda game . Little to my surprise this game has become one of my fav games so far in recent years.  Dlc for this game would be awesome to. It's such an incredible game that anyone on modern or last gen could experience it.  Prince of Persia lost crown has some great fun addicting gameplay very pretty  looking graphics ( I gamed on series x with 4k tv ) yet still would look pretty just not as clear on 1080 . 1440 or whatever resolutions ur max say if ur on PC.  This game took me by surprise . I was not expecting prince of Persia to be this good.  Prior to this I think it was Sands of time that was the best one . Now sands of time has to take a 2nd place spot.","7 people found this helpful."
"Ric Sw","a year ago","A true gem that shows that you don't need realistic high-def graphics to be a great game. The gameplay is extremely fun,intuitive,and easy to learn.
The game plays like it's early predecessor and current games like Metroid Dread though at least with this one you don't have a killer machine chasing you all through the levels.
The gameplay mechanics are again easy to learn and remember without the need to learn a hundred different combos or techniques you usually have to with most current games nowadays. Traversal is also easy for the most part but you do need to explore as well as it isn't quite a point A to point B system.
Ubisoft finally has given us a title game that wasn't based of yet another Assassin Creed or some FarCry game but one that they left dormant for a few years and thankfully have reawakened. Now Ubisoft give us a new Rayman game and you'll make even more gamers happy to still be loyal customers for your IP title games.","7 people found this helpful."
"William Cryer","a year ago","I was skeptical at first but after playing the demo I was hooked. Now I have the game and it‚Äôs amazing. The story line is cool. The combat is amazing and so is the movement. The map is MASSIVE but not a complete pain to traverse partly due to fast travel points and also the fluid movement. The puzzles are fun and not to hard but im sure that won‚Äôt be the case for everyone. My only complaint is some of the puzzlers can be hard to navigate with the way the skills are button mapped but you can always make a preset on the switch to deal with that. it‚Äôs only 49.99 on switch which is cool compared to other similar games. I definitely suggest PPLC to anyone that is into or wants to get into metroidvania style games. Also if you‚Äôre worried about difficulty it has a gameplay customization that allows you to tweak it how you‚Äôd like. Not just easy medium hard. Good job Ubisoft.","8 people found this helpful."
"Hamid Amini","2 months ago","I went into The Lost Crown with tempered expectations, but I was thoroughly impressed. This platformer expertly captures the spirit of classic Prince of Persia titles. From the intricate puzzles and treacherous traps to the challenging pathfinding, the core gameplay is undeniably strong. Enemy encounters are well-balanced, offering a satisfying challenge without feeling insurmountable.
The addition of perks and combo systems adds a layer of depth and encourages experimentation. The level design is meticulously crafted, demanding careful observation and attention to detail. Visually, The Lost Crown boasts a striking art style, but it's the soundtrack that truly shines, it's a masterpiece.
While the gameplay is excellent, the story and characters also contribute significantly to the overall experience. The narrative, though not groundbreaking, is engaging and well-paced. The protagonist, Sargon, is a compelling character, and his journey of self-discovery resonates with the player.
Overall, The Lost Crown is a fantastic game that offers a satisfying and nostalgic experience. It's a testament to the enduring appeal of the Prince of Persia series.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Roxx","6 months ago","I was hesitant to get this game because I thought we'd get a full blown prince of persia high end graphics game. But, this is not bad. A lot of people were complaining about the prince looking different, but the character that you play as is not even the prince. It's a different character. The game has different puzzles/platforms that truly bring the prince of persia feel into it. Sargon is voiced by the same actor who voices Orpheus from BG3 so that's awesome. You can use different abilities and move sets. The story so far is pretty interesting. There is a metroidvania component where you have to backtrack to previous areas, but you can have a guided map and add markers or choose to explore with minimal help. Also, I appreciate all the accessibility options that the developers added which should allow hardcore gamers and casual gamers alike to enjoy it. I got this on sale, and I am so glad I did. I am really enjoying it!!","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Amir Hanaei","9 months ago","I am around 30 now and the last Prince of Persia game I had played was The Sands of Time. Having heard about the new Prince of Persia game, I thought I'd give it a shot but I didn't have my hopes up too high at first since it was a platformer. The first thing that enthused me was the Persian language support. I was thrilled to play a game and hear the dialogues in Persian. It felt so unique to me. The voice acting was shockingly flawless. The voices truly matched the characters.
Another point that truly felt special was the Persian mythology. As a Persian, I had heard about Mount Qaf, Persepolis, Simurq, etc. Seeing all that in an awesome story with eye catching environment graphics was on another level. This game had me play it for hours and never skip a single cut scene (so unusual for someone who usually does only to delve right into action)

But based on the hype and previews, I picked this game up day one and I was not disappointed. Metroidvania turns out to be a perfect fit for this classic series IP, and the epic story does the genre justice. Not only that, but I was able to play a Persian story in Persian( with English subtitles)! The rich mythology of Persia suffuses the storyline and there's a ton more to dive into in collectibles. This game is a hands down must-play for all fans of platform action.","7 people found this helpful."
"Thomas Moore","3 months ago","This game is a gem and for me is the best Metroidvania ever. Having just recently replayed castlevania SOTN, for me castlevania OOE was vastly superior and this is even better than both!

 I feel like PoP LC is a victim of the time and Ubisoft unfortunately. Many people thought this game would be ""woke"" because the protagonist isn't the prince but a guy who's a darker skinned Persian. But there is literally nothing ""woke"" about the game nor the story. 

I think people also had some reservations about the graphics but most videos you see are from the early levels.  Once you reach other areas this quickly becomes a BEAUTIFUL and atmospheric game with varying biomes that make you feel like you're really in different places. 

The combat is nice and fluid plus there is just the right amount as you explore the various areas which never get old when you revisit with new gained powers. By the end of the game Sargon is pretty powerful but it's something you have built up to if you take the time to find everything so it doesn't feel cheap. 

This game is a masterpiece to me and I'm sad that there won't be a part 2..... don't miss out on this because PoP LC returns to its roots and is an amazing game!","2 people found this helpful."

The way they designed the map, and made backtracking fun and accessible to anyone was like few games I've previously played.

I have been disappointed several times over the last year with certain releases chief amongst those being Starfield. So for a gem like this to come along and blow me away feels good.

I love everything about this game from the joyous combat to the challenging and exhilarating platforming. Games like this under the so called Metroidvania genre can be very hit or miss with me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm one of the few but I was not a fan of Metroid Dread. However when a game like The Lost Crown can use there platforming mechanics in such inventive ways it‚Äôs thrilling once you figure out the steps and spots that used to be confound you become easy to traverse. At least until you get lazy and forget a step and have to do it all over again.

The combat is just as much fun as you‚Äôd want it to be. The sprawling map you unlock is filled with different types of enemies from the easiest to the one you can barely scratch and just have to figure out a way around. There‚Äôs one in particular that is the stuff of nightmares.

Prince of Persia The Lost Crown is a great achievement in the 2D platforming games and a reminder that such games can still be fun in the days of massive 3D open world games.

Spoiler alert, the bosses fights later on can be very challenging, there is an option to customize the damage you receive that help a lot, you can also get help for the hard platforming places.  I actually surprised myself being able to do many of those hard parts.

The game is trial and errors, i died so many times, and sometimes the checkpoints are awful. Make sure you find as many soma trees as you can they are save and checkpoints.

There are some puzzles and so really made me mad, the clock tower is one of them were i almost gave up on the game, i had to redo that one like 30 times. Sad the devs did not include a skip puzzle option. 

The game for a 2d is beautiful, and its really fun to play. But be warned there are difficulty spikes.","Was this review helpful to you?"

What I liked about it:
- fast paced, runs fast, smooth actions
- lots of special skills obtained and used
- challenging, lots of fights and puzzles
- big map, lots of varieties
- great graphics
- has a nostalgic feel to it, feels like the 1st original version of the game with better graphics and game play

What I don't like about it:
- 2d not 3d
- too repetitive running around the same screens (you have to do a LOT of the same screens just to get to a fast travel spot to fast travel)
- a lot of screens are just empty ie. you come in from the left and exit the right with nothing to do, time consuming or outright boring
- some fights and puzzles are extremely difficult and needs 'exact' timing to complete which is very frustrating even on easy level
- could have done something similar to Zelda where it's more open world and complete things in different sequence. I think it tries, with the side quests, but still it just didn't feel the same","3 people found this helpful."

"Jordan G","8 months ago","I am a big fan of the prince of persia series I have played all of the games wether it is the original, the 3D ones ps2/Xbox or the psp ones.

Many of these games were excellent with a few being straight out masterpieces like two thrones , prince of persia (reboot) or simply the original.

I am someone that judges a game whitin the first level. I feel like a game that does not make me excited whether it is with gameplay stories or visuals within the first ""level"" is not worth playing and to be fair I end up being usually right.

So prince of perisa this time around pleasantly surprised me with a strong opening. A first level that made me feel quite badass, and a smooth gameplay that was just overall fun.

The gameplay reminded me quite a lot of the prince of persia forgotten sands on psp which was in my opinion a excellent game.

The game is quite easy and is pretty far from the ideology of the die and retry that the original game had. 

This is not necessarily something bad as to me the feeling ubisoft always brought to their older games was the feeling of being badass and overpowered being able to mow down dozen of enemies. Something they lost nowadays to pursue a more soul like and rpg approch. 

Something that I think should not be the main focus of an assasins creed game or in this case a prince of persia game.

my general point of view is that while I was very septic of a revival of the series I was excited and have so far not being disappointed with the result.

Well done ubisoft, this is the kind of games I have been waiting for. 
This ubisoft is the path to a better success of all your games.
Reflect on your past games, identify why they were the cream of the cream and reproduce that.

I remember buying ubisoft games and always link them to a quality certification. I want to feel that way again.
I believe this company can find their golden age back.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Jason Dismukes","a year ago","This game is everything I was hoping to be and more! The fluidity of the game play is nothing more than outstanding! Especially on the Switch console. Easily one of the best purchases I have made on this system. Tremendous effort by Ubisoft for even attempting at revitalizing a very old series, which of course they have done! This is bay far my favorite 2D side scrolling metroidvania game!","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Nick Bishop","a year ago","Great game on a surface level. 

Controls are fairly smooth. The combat against smaller mobs is very fun, and has great challenge scale depending on dodge vs parrying. I've found most bosses seem to round down to; dodge or parry, basic attack, anthra attack, repeat. Fun but not much variety.

Story is... okay? Honestly... the VA killed it for me. I have to say this is possibly the worse VA I've had to suffer through. I've found myself skipping 99% of the dialogue, so I guess the story could be good, I just don't care. Also, the (not so) little tid bits gathered around the world are painfully long and frankly, boring. 

Graphics and art style are great. I have no real opinion. They're done well and nothing really stands out as awesome nor amateur.

Overall I would recommend this game to anyone. I definitely wouldn't give this a 5 star review and honestly 4 is generous but if this game goes on sale I think it's a good time.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Dhia Rezki Rohaizad","10 months ago","Honestly, this game was really, really fun to play. I didn't know what to expect from a side-scroller game like this, but it really did surpass my expectations. I played Hollow Knight and really enjoyed the exploration aspect of that game along with its unique design and gameplay. I would say Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown brought a similar feeling but to an elevated extent. The combat was really, reallly, really enjoyable, and the platforming was challenging but gurrrrl, was it rewarding. 10/10 would recommend.","Was this review helpful to you?"

"Ali Zonoozi","6 months ago","As a fan of the OG prince Persia game and also someone with Persian background, I was pretty reluctant to buy this game since I feared it would ruin my memories of the old game and had low expectations. But boy was I wrong. 
The Ubisoft nailed it with the gameplay and telling of Persian mythology in this game. The graphics are nothing crazy and I think it could be better but the animations are super nice and the scene background and the whole environment reminded me of the original prince of Persia game and created dejavu moments. The map is quite big and the boss fights are manageable when you get the hang of it. 
I also appreciated the Persian voice dubbing but it just became repetitive and weird after some point for me so I had to switch to English.
Overall I suggest that you lower your expectation so you can enjoy the game more like me.","1 person found this helpful."
"John Weed","a year ago","Prince of Persia is back in another game Lost Crown.  Game play and attacks are smooth and fluid. BUT I won't be buying the game as it is 2D side scroller.  Took all the best aspects of the game and flattened it. Sorry it was so much better 3D as it placed you in the world that you became Sargon (even though it was a track runner). This is Wolfenstein in Persia.  Cut scenes are gorgeous in 3D why not the game? The demo is a good place to start to see if you like the game as it allows you to run through several fights. I was so looking forward to getting my hands on this .Just not for me - don't care (take me back to 1990s). I am also bummed that there isn't any SANDS OF TIME effects (not sure why as you are picking up  TIME SHARDS throughout the game) why would you take a great game like POP and deficate on the franchise? You could have called it something else or just LOST CROWN and started a new franchise","13 people found this helpful."
"Beau Sierens","a year ago","As a Metroidvania fan, I love this game.  At it's core, tt is as good a triple A iteration to genre as there has been in a long time.  However, in the early days of release there are some serious glitches as you work through the game.  There is one where you inexplicably get stuck in a room because the door closes after you enter and won't reopen.  Luckily restarting from a save fixed it for me.  When exploring the western part of the map (around 2/3 completion) the game inexplicably replayed the intro cinema when I got back to that landmark in the game.  Now, I am facing the boss Orom and twice I have defeated him only to have his body freeze on the ground in some glitched state and I cannot get past this point of the game.  This would be an easy 5 star game for me without the glitches.  Fix it, UbiSoft!","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Eleonora Volante (Ele/Leo)","a month ago","the art, the story and the combat are incredible, but the exploration is basically the main part of the game and it's almost unbearable. really? manual save? If I'm playing the new prince of persia I expect at least an auto save, yk? to save those 5 hours lost in trying to get back where you were? and the quick travel is basically useless except for some times doing the main mission where the next mission would be in the opposite part of the map just to make you walk a bit, since you never do in this game, yk?
Also getting to the main objectives is ridiculously hard, you find a way? but that's the wrong way!! thats how you come out of the puzzle! you have to redo all the things you've just done to go through all the long way to get back there without dying or you'll loose all the progress you've done!! it makes no sense, it's just annoying. 
the mobs are so interesting but you can't expect me to go through a 5 wave of elite enemies just to accidentally go the wrong way, come back and have to do it again because of the room reset. Isn't this supposed to be new?? it has all the major issues the first ones had but this time is worse and completely on purpose.
It's not even about the game being too difficult, it's really not, it's just unbearable and extremely overwhelming (at least for me), I loved it so far but I'm afraid I won't finish it, I don't have the time for redoing the same shit 8 times just because a single bullet of venom or fire hit me and now it will never stop, also while fighting another 3 enemies, dodging spikes on tiny time platforms, doing a puzzle and a quick time event. I'm sorry this is just too much.
If I wanted the issues of a 90s game I would play a game from the 90s.","Was this review helpful to you?"

The Lost Crown has one boss fight in particular that is so ridiculously hard that after a dozen attempts I thought to myself ""This isn't worth it."" The concept of Balance totally eludes Ubisoft and it is painfully obvious in all their games really. Whether it's difficulty, map size, amount of content, it's always out of whack and this game is no exception. It's a real shame too because the game mechanics here are really good and some puzzles are very cleverly designed.  But Ubisoft once again gets in its own way.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Nino Mi≈°kulin","10 months ago","I will never undestand games like these. It is a fun idea, but in the end it failed. When you die, and you die all the time because your character is as strong as a paperboat, you get respawned 10 minutes away from the places you died. You have to walk all the way back doing stupid and broken platforming that you did 150 times before. Boss battles are terrible, not because they are difficult, but because you need to die 50 times in order to remember all their moves so you can counter it. In other games that had hard bosses like say Stellar Blade, there is a chance for you to defeat it at first try if your skill is good enough. In this game, your skill doesn't matter at all, because there are no skills that you can learn. Its just 5 moves you need to do and each counters one specific attack of the boss. Its not fun, because everytime you face a boss, you know that you will die 50 times untill you learn what to to against it. Awful, awful game. Played it for about 15 hours and then deleted it and threw it in the trash can.","7 people found this helpful."

"Angel Paz","a year ago","26% into the game. Didnt care much at first, then i started to really enjoy the game. It seemed very simplistic and basic. The map reminds me alot of metroid. It really feels like a throwback to Nintendo or sega. Now i find myself addicted to this game.","Was this review helpful to you?"
"Robert Headley","11 months ago","I personally love the Ubisoft open world formula used by Assassin's creed and Farcry, but this... this is a very solid metroidvania developed by the Rayman team. This is a great game, everyone who likes metroidvanias needs to play and own this one.","Was this review helpful to you?"

"garry fletch","a year ago","Woke game. There sales are terrible and I'm not surprised. They changed the main characteristic with an unknown character that does not fit the time period. People want to play the main character without race swapping. The trailer rap music was  trash and kept the game from selling. Lost half its fans right from the beginning.","4 people found this helpful."
